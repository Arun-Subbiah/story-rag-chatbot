Then when we come back, all our friends would still be gone. \n\nAswin nods\n\nAswin \nThe third option is to travel back one hour ago. Go to AAARCC and stop Agent C from killing our friends. Simultaneously, the version of ourselves at that time would still be defeating Nidarshan like we just did now. When we return, our friends would remain unharmed while Nidarshan still gets put behind bars. One shot to stop him. \n\nJason \nI prefer Option 1. With a time machine from the future, imagine all we could do and research. An extremely advanced high technology device in our very hands. Imagine all the money by selling the machine. Our names would get engraved into every science and history book! Then we can still go back and save your friends.",
