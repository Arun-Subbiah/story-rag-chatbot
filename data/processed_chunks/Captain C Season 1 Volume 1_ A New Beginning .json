For days, the chettiars of the chettinad region had sensed something was amiss. The whisper of the winds was unsettling and the coconut trees spoke with warning. Elders prayed to the local deities, begging for lord Murugan to spare their land from destruction. A great danger was encroaching upon these people. \n\nA great meteor struck upon the Chettinad region, wiping out the Chettiar caste.The Chettinad region was left in ruins and no one was left to tell the tale. The once thriving Chettinad region, with bustling market streets and populated temples, was now engulfed in chaos and despair.",

Clearing out the ruins of this house, they found a baby. This baby was untouched by flame and debris. He was covered by a Murugan picture frame that had fallen on him, protecting him from the impact. He was the sole survivor of this catastrophe. \n\nWith gentle hands, an elderly police officer lifted up the baby in the air.

In the days leading up to the meteor, I was left at my neighbors house as my parents had both gone to Chennai to get our VISAs done to move to Singapore. I grew up in Singapore and displayed heightened strength from a young age. My time in the military was crucial to my development. I was then sent to college at Purdue University, where I currently study mechanical engineering. I am a staunch devotee of lord Murugan. And yes, I am a superhero.\u201d\nShot of Aswin driving across the Lafayette - West Lafayette bridge, entering West Lafayette. \nAswin",

I eventually donned the identity of Captain C, a local superhero in the Purdue area. I am a protector of the campus, a guardian of the everyday people. I made some friends, who are all a part of the South Indian Association. I joined the Operations committee, and these people became my best friends. My circle of friends included Negha, Sai, Aadit, Hitha, Rishika, Sanjana, and Priya. There were more people in the extended SIA group as well, including the treasurer Nidarshan. At first my identity was a secret and nobody knew that I was Captain C- the superhero admired by all of Purdue. Eventually, I told my circle and they began assisting me on my missions. Adit helped me develop my weapons and modify my car(the Chettiarmobile) while the rest of the CS students help provide technological support",
