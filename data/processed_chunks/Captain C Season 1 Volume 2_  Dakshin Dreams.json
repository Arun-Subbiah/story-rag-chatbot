    "text": "Captain C Vol.2: Dakshin Dreams \n\tSunset was minutes away in beautiful West Lafayette. The sky was a calculated swirl of pink and yellow, with peaks of the orange sun seeping through the drifting clouds. Above the Wabash River was the bridge that divided West Lafayette and Lafayette. This bridge was illuminated by the warm, golden light of the setting sun, which casted long, graceful shadows across its length. The gentle rush of the river complemented by the rhythm of ducks quacking created a serene harmony in the air. Aswin stood at the midpoint of the bridge, looking over and admiring the view. This peaceful scene contrasted sharply with the storm that was brewing within Aswin\u2019s complex mind.",

    "text": "It was Friday. It was the end of a long week of introductory classes for Aswin in his first week back from break. There was no apparent crime that had taken place since his return- at least not yet. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this was an irregularity, and his mind churned with the fear that a great danger was awaiting the city. \n\tThe slight breeze rustled his hair and he closed his eyes, letting the gentle rhythms of the river calm his mind. The sun had finally set, and dusk had risen. Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Aswin eagerly fumbled his phone out of his pocket, and saw that it was a text from Negha: \u201cWhere are you? We\u2019re already here!\u201d  \nA smile spread across Aswin\u2019s handsome face. He had completely forgotten in the midst of sightseeing; he was supposed to meet his friends for dinner at Dakshin! He set off jogging towards the direction of Dakshin, leaving his worries behind on the bridge.",

The rich aroma of south Indian spices filled the air, making his mouth water with eagerness. He spotted his friends gathered at a table in the back of the small restaurant. Their faces were lit with laughter and happiness. \nASWIN \nHey everyone, sorry I\u2019m late\nNegha\nGrinning\nAs usual",

However, nobody is there. \nAswin looks around but there is no staff around. He hears some arguing in the kitchen beyond the counter. \nAswin leans back and places his elbow to rest along the counter.

The camera first follows Sai Aiswarya\u2019s side of the room and circularly loops around to Sanjana\u2019s side. The messy nature of the room is emphasized by this shot, especially the mountain of items on the chairs. The shot ends with focus on an alarm clock reading the time: 10:55 am. The creative emphasis is to get a lived in or interactive feeling of the room and to form a closer connection with the characters Sanjana and Sai Aiswarya.\nSanjana \nOh no!
