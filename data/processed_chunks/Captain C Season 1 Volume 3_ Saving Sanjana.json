The room was covered in darkness with only an alarm clock providing a gentle glow.\n\nStage 1: Light Sleep \nAswin\u2019s breathing slowed and his body relaxed. His mind slowly edged away from his worries about the city, and drifted into the first stage of sleep.\n\nStage 2: Onset of Sleep\nAswin\u2019s body temperature dropped slightly and his heartbeat steadied into a predictive rhythm. His twisted consciousness slipped further and further away, leaving him in a peaceful state of rest.\n\nStage 3: Deep Sleep\nThe world outside became a distant memory for Aswin as he entered deep sleep. Aswin was oblivious to the real world, where the stress of the everyday terrorized him. His body and mind were rejuvenating. He was recovering from a long week of balancing between being Captain C and being Aswin.",

A vivid dream filled his mind and transported him to a different world.\n\nFirst, Aswin was on a field of dandelions.  Aswin joyfully frolicked across the field, without a worry in the world. As he ran, brown feathered birds flew with him, as if they were challenging him to a race! A dark shadow of a woman could be seen from a distance. She was performing bharatanatyam. Aswin started running towards her.\n\nSuddenly, the ground began trembling. A giant crater opened up under Aswin\u2019s feet. He began to fall through, into a void of perpetual darkness. Aswin yelled, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to go!\u201d",

    "text": "Aswin landed with a loud thud. He looked around, analyzing his environment. Aswin was back on the bridge overlooking the Wabash River from earlier that day. However, something was off; this wasn\u2019t the same place. Although it was seemingly daytime, the sky was dark and murky. The bridge was enveloped in dark vines and seemed extremely filthy. The smell of death infected the air. This place was dystopian. Aswin panicked. This bridge was his happy place. It was the spot he would go to clear his mind. Seeing it in this state of disarray shattered his heart. He tried running away, but every time he reached the end of the bridge, he was magically transported back to the center of the bridge. Aswin was trapped in a cycle! His breathing picked up. Again, and again, and again, he couldn\u2019t escape. Aswin shrieked,\u201d LET ME GO, PLEA-\u201c",

Aswin was drenched in sweat. He fumbled for his phone on his nightstand, blinking against the harsh glare of the screen. The call was from Negha.\n\nAswin\nVoice groggy \nNegha, it\u2019s 2:45 am!\n\nNegha\nAswin, it\u2019s Sanjana. You need to come quick. She\u2019s gone\n\nAswin\u2019s Eyes fill with terror \n\nAswin \nOkay, I\u2019ll be there right away \n\nNegha\nAswin\u2026 I\u2019m scared \n\nAswin\nIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m coming.

The camera is behind Aswin as he opens his cupboard, goes to the end of his shirts that are hung up, and stares for a moment.

This curb is kind of isolated, don\u2019t you think?\n\nAswin \nSai! Excellent observation.
