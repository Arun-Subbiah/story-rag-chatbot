Students were terrified and consumed with the fear that they would be next. Purdue university began receiving national attention and large numbers of cops were dispatched to patrol the campus. \n\nCaptain C title sequence plays with Captain C theme music\n\nAswin is driving into the Dakshin parking lot. The time in his car reads 11:58am. He parks and enters Dakshin. He walks up to the counter. A man with a mustache emerges from the kitchen and meets Aswin at the cash register.\n\nAswin(Thinking: Voice Over) \nThis guy is familiar. He took my order last night. He was the one who was arguing with another guy in the kitchen before coming out late to take my order. \n\nMan \nWelcome sir what would you like to have?\n\nAswin \nHi, I would like one masala dosa please\n\nMan \nSorry sir, no dosa today \n\nAswin \nOk, then chicken biryani",

The kitchen is empty except for Mr. Naraynan cooking at the stove. \n\nAswin \nNo chef. Interesting\u2026 But there was a chef the other day\u2026 that chef was the one who was arguing with Naraynan \n\nAswin sees Mr. Naraynan walk over to the corner of the kitchen. He looks behind his back twice before kneeling down and opening a trap door attached to the ground. He enters inside and uses a ladder to get down.",

We now have our ten. The boss will be here tonight to pick them all up. Any problems with the job?\n\nSuresh \nNo sir, all of them were smooth. Except the first girl with the curly hair, the one who came in last night. She put up quite a fight. If it weren\u2019t for the new tranquilizer, I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve taken her. Why was the boss so intent on kidnapping her? \n\nMr. Naraynan \nI\u2019m not sure, but she was his number one target. The rest we kidnapped, he didn\u2019t care about. But for this girl, he even gave us her picture to keep in case she ever walked in the restaurant.",

Even though the weapon still was sprayed and was enough to sedate her, the test tube fell and shattered. \n\nMr. Naraynan \nHmmm.. I\u2019m not sure that is enough to lead back to us. \n\nThe sound of disassembling is heard.

He is the one who is making all the tranquilizers. \n\nSuresh\nAnd one more thing. I brought our supply van to kidnap her, the one where we have all our groceries. In the rush, I forgot to close the van door. After I was able to tranquilize her, I quickly sped out of the parking lot and ran over a curb. Some rice bags that were cut in the fight spilled out as I ran over the curb.",
