Camera follows two boys walking down the stairs and entering a room on the far end. They walk in and look up at the scrieen, which displays: SIA Callout #2. \n\nThe boys look at eachother and wink. They then walk all the way to the first row of people and sit down. There are about 20 people in the audience and Negha and Sanjana are standing in front of the screen to give their presentation. Priya is sitting towards the side against the wall. \n\nNegha\nHey everyone, welcome to our second callout\n\nBoy #1 \nHi brah \n\nNegha\nHello. My name is Negha and I am the vice president. \n\nSanjana\nHi everyone, I\u2019m the president of SIA. Here\u2019s some of the things we do.",

After three seconds, the screen reappears and boy #2 suddenly waking up is shown. \n\nNegha\nAnd now we are going to move on to some games\n \nTime lapse shot of the game where two different Indian food or items are shown on the screen and people have to vote for which one they like more\n\nSanjana\nNow we\u2019re going to play a game where you have to say something in your native language out loud, and then the others have to guess the meaning.\n\nNegha\nBut you have to tell us the phrase first. It has to be school appropriate!\n\nCut to a guy walking up in front of the screen \n\nGuy \nPoda en Chips!\n\nThe room is silent \n\nNegha\nOk guys this is the end of the callout, if anyone wants to stay back and play mafia feel free!",

A group of 5 in black karate outfits are there. The sensei is at the front of the room. \n\nPriya walks to the front of the room and bows. \n\nSense\nWelcome, Priya. For you, today is a special night. It is your final test before you can receive your black belt and become a master. For your final test, you will have to defeat fellow master Kenji in a duel. \n\nPriya\nYes, Sensei \n\nPriya glances over to see Kenji, a tall and extremely muscular man in a black karate outfit, already standing in the center of the room. \n\nSense\nThe rules are simple. Use your skills, knowledge, and wooden sword to disarm and defeat Kenji. \n\nPriya walks to the middle of the room, standing face to face with Kenji\n\nKenji bows to Priya, Priya bows to Kenji.\n\nSensei \nBest of luck, young grasshopper.

Priya jumps, does a double front flip over Kenji, and lands facing Kenji. Kenji is confused as to where Priya went. Priya taps Kenji on the back with her sword. Kenji is startled and turns around in awe. \n\nPriya \nLooking for someone?\n\nKenji\u2019s eyebrows cross in anger. Kenji launches into a flurry of attacks, each one faster and more powerful than the last. Priya uses her agility to dodge these, her movements a blur as she anticipates Kenji\u2019s strikes. She ducks under a powerful overhead swing and counters with a low sweep, tripping Kenji and sending him to the ground.",

As she notices, a box falls out of his backpack. But the student doesn\u2019t notice and continues to walk. \n\nPriya is Alarmed. What if this box is of importance! \n\nPriya rushes forward and gets past through the crowd and picks up the box. She looks ahead but the owner is gone. The red backpack is nowhere in sight.
