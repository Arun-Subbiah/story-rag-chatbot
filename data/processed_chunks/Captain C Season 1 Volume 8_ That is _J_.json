I remember it clearly. And look, there\u2019s even that small tear on the side \n\nCamera focuses on the backpack with haunting music \n\nAswin \nWell, there\u2019s only one way to make sure it\u2019s him \n\nArun \nLet\u2019s open it. Let\u2019s check if those vials you mentioned are there\n\nNegha \nBut that\u2019s an invasion of his privacy!\n\nAswin walks past Negha and walks over to the bag. He reaches down and starts to zip open the bag. Camera goes to his POV of opening the bag with the camera pointing at the bag \n\nAs the bag is being opened, cut to\u2026 \n\nCaptain C Title Sequence with Captain C theme song \n\nCut to bag being opened\n\nAswin \n(Opens the backpack, staring into it with growing confusion)\nIt's... empty\u2026\n\nPriya\n(Leaning in, her brow furrowing)\nEmpty? That can\u2019t be right. The vials... they should be there",

He is probably not far from here. If we run we can catch him!\n\nArun and Aswin run out the door and zoom through Stuart. They race up the stairs past a clock that reads 8:30pm. The camera focuses on the clock. They dash out the Stuart door across the PMU. Arun and Aswin stop in their tracks.

He gets a call, speaks for 20 seconds. Then he texts for about 30 seconds. Then he puts the phone back in his pocket. He then continues to walk down the street.",

Jason waves to a few boys in the back of the store and sits with them.\n\nArun \nHuh.. Maybe it is just a coincidence. Two backpacks that look the same but belong to different people \n\nAswin \nCould be.. Priya did say that Jason\u2019s backpack matched up perfectly with the one she saw in the Corec.. Down to the finest details.. \n\nArun \nBut thinking about it, it makes perfect sense.

They say that\u2019s where the bioweapons might be manufactured. \n\nPriya \nThat\u2019s pretty risky.. If they get caught, they could be severely punished, even expelled!\n\nSai \nThis is traumatizing",

Just as he is about to open the door, the door suddenly swings open with force, slamming into Aswin\u2019s face. He stumbles back, clutching his face in pain.
