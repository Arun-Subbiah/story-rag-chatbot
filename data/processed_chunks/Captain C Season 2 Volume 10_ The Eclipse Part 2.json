    "text": "Recap: The SIA Guardians follow the trail of clues and uncover the AI which is used as a tool by Hisham. They interact with the AI, and discover that Operation N is a plot to rescue Nidarshan from jail. The cult plans to activate the ancient chettiar rocks on the day of the eclipse, and insert them into the chettiar blaster- a mass destructive weapon. The guardians start their journey to Lagoda, but Hisham\u2019s cult is tipped off by Jiapei. Hisham moves his camp to Brownsburg park. On the way to the park, the guardians recreate the serum that is used to free cult members from the curse. They load this serum in water guns. When they arrive in Lagoda, the park is empty and the cult is nowhere to be found. They are heartbroken and pathless, sulking in the fear that Hisham will complete Operation N unopposed and eventually rescue Nidarshan. And then suddenly, the sun grows brighter, and the light seems to be getting closer\u2026",
