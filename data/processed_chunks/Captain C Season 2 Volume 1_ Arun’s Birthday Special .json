The beauty of the bridge was unimaginable; it was as if a million butterflies performed a coordinated dance routine choreographed by Negha. \n\nArun\nHalfway through my fourth semester\u2026 This semester has been a blur to say the least. All starting with meeting Aswin at the AAARCC, discovering I wasn\u2019t the only chettiar, and then training in the way of the chettiar. Over a month has passed since the real challenge we faced: putting a stop to Nidarshan\u2019s Project C.\n\nArun sighs\n\nArun \nNidarshan is in jail. This city is finally calm. But how long will it take for a new threat to emerge? \n\nArun sighs and looks at the sky \n\nArun \nThese days of peace and tranquility, I\u2019ll cherish them now. Because when danger approaches, I know I\u2019ll be the first in line to stop it.",

Arun reaches for his pocket and pulls his phone out. \n\nAswin(On Phone)\nArun, hurry up! They\u2019re calling you for dance practice. This is the second to last practice before the mock Kalyanam on Sunday!\n\nArun \nOh, Jai! I\u2019m on my way!\n\nArun puts his head down and starts jogging past the fountain and up the hill as the camera moves up from Arun and up to the sunset. As the camera focuses on the sun setting in the clouds\u2026. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCaptain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
