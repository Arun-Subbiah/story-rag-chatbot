The gym is pitch black. A couple of guests let out squeals of panic. \n\nAswin \nIt\u2019s alright everyone, I\u2019ll go check on the lights\n\nSuddenly, the lights start flickering for a few seconds, before going out dark again. \n\nAswin looks up at the lights, eyeing them suspiciously \n\nAswin turns to Arun \n\nAswin \nSomething is wrong \n\nArun \nSeriously wrong",

The screen is fully black except for the center of the screen, where a white circle remains. \n\nThe guests look in awe, confused as to if this is part of the event or not. \n\nSuddenly, the speakers blast with screams of terror. The guests cover their ears and begin to shake in fear. Some guests run to the exits and try to open the doors in an attempt to escape the horrors of the room. Chaos erupts in the feature gym. \n\nA voice screeches through the speakers \n\nVoice\nThis event is over!\n\nVikas XL looks around at the panic\n\nVikas XL\nThinking\nAnd I didn\u2019t even get to eat food\u2026\n\nHitha turns to look at Negha.
