He bolts up the stairs as Superstar Hisham bursts out the door and races to catch up to Aswin. Aswin, in his state of panic, trips on the last stair and falls to the ground. Hisham stands above him.\n\nHisham maniacally laughs- Chitti Laugh\n\nHisham \nSo boy\u2026 you\u2019ve fallen into our net \n\nAswin eyes him with malice\n\nAswin jumps to his feet and throws a punch at Hisham.
