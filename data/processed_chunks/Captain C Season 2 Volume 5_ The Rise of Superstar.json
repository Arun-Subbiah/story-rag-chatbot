The moon\u2019s bright reflection illuminates the river. It is the day of the super moon. Hisham admires the moon. The moon was as beautiful as his own instagram posts.\n\nHisham opens up his backpack and reveals a collection of red/brownish colored rocks. He takes out one of the rocks and brings it to the river. He kneels and cleans the rock, washing it off of all its dust. \n\nHisham takes out his phone. 11:59 pm. \n\nHisham\nIt\u2019s almost time \n\nHisham places the rock in the air, directly under the glow of the moon. The moon\u2019s bright reflection falls upon the rock. The rock begins to tremble in Hisham\u2019s hands. \n\nHisham reads the time on his phone. 12 am.",
