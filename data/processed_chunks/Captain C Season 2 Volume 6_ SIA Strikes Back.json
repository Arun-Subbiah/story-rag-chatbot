Sai Aiswarya screams in terror. Negha uses her nails to scratch Sai Aiswarya\u2019s face. Sai Aiswarya kicks her feet in distress, knocking the grande iced white mocha in the air. The drink\u2019s lid pops open, and the drink falls all over Negha\u2019s head. \n\nNegha stops attacking Sai Aiswarya and freezes. Suddenly, her feet lift off the ground and she begins floating in the air for a few seconds. Then, Negha drops to the floor with a thud.\n\nSai Aiswarya\nNegha! Are you okay!
