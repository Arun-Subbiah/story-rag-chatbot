Three of these individuals are standing at the front of the group. \n\nHisham pulls off his hood to reveal his face. He is at the front of the cult. The boys on the left and right of Hisham take off their hoods and masks. Sahil and Anurag stand on each side of Hisham. \n\nHisham \nBring it on!\n\nAswin looks at Sai Aiswarya and Negha on one side, and then at Arun on the other side. Arun and Aswin nod.\n\nAswin \nIt\u2019s chettiar time!\n\nAswin and Arun race towards the terrifying cult with the rage to hurt. The cultists race forward in front of Hisham, Anurag, and Sahil. Arun and Aswin attempt to attack them, but are instantly swarmed and knocked to the ground.\n\nSai Aiswarya and Negha attempt to fight off a few of these enemies, but they too are overwhelmed by the sheer size of the army.\n\nArun \nThere\u2019s too many of them!\n\nSai Aiswarya \nWe need more of us!",

The AI named Jai is working on its own to hack into social media accounts and send mean messages. Arun explains how the AI is becoming more advanced day by day, and eventually it could get past university systems on a larger scale. He explains that the day all screens in Purdue displayed the message, \u201cJAI\u201d, was the first step of this goal. The AI is working as an agent to organize and maximize Hisham\u2019s success in his cult operations, by running multiple models and extracting the best possible outcomes. \n\nArun \nThankfully, the AI isn\u2019t fully autonomous and is open to human intervention.
