This adventure is just too good!\n\nSanta\u2019s sleigh gracefully lands on top of Hawkins Hall, as he instructs his reindeer to come to a stop. \n\nSanta Claus\nI\u2019ve covered almost all of campus. Now I just have to deliver gifts for this one last friend group. \n\nSanta squints his eyes at the list \n\nSanta Claus\nSIA? All on the nice list. Excellent.\n\nSanta Claus reaches into his big bag and searches for the bag containing the SIA gifts. \n\nSanta Claus\nMust be at the bottom!\n\nSanta Claus searches the entire bag, but the SIA gifts are just not there.\n\nMissing.\n\nSanta takes out his candy cane phone from his belt. Santa dials the number of his operations manager and security chief, Subramani, and presses call.\n\nSubramani\nYellow?\n\nSanta Claus\nSubramaniam! We have a case of missing gifts. \n\nSubramani \nMissing gifts? This has never happened before, ever!",

Whoever that is can help me recover the gifts\n\nSubramani \nGot it, chief.\n\nSubramani scours his database to locate the closest superhero to the West Lafayette-Lafayette region. To speed up the process, he runs an optimized SQL query, filtering by proximity, activity level, and recent mission logs. Only one name is returned by the query.\n\nSubramani \nThere\u2019s one superhero, just one\n\nSanta Claus\nThe name?\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\n\nCaptain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song",

Patch me through to him, Subramani. We\u2019ve got no time to waste.

Without it, Christmas is at stake for some students. Are you in?\n\nAswin\nSaving Christmas? Sounds like a job worth doing. Send me the details, and I\u2019ll get on it\n\nSanta Claus\nDetails incoming. Subramani, guide him. I\u2019ll continue on with the rest of the presents \n\nSubramani\nRoger that, Santa. Let\u2019s save Christmas\n\nCaptain C springs into action by jumping off the swing and getting into the driver\u2019s seat of the chettiar-mobile. He waits for the car to heat up before driving, to ensure the engine oil circulates properly. Then, he backs out the car and drives it up the hill.\n\nAswin \nWhere was Santa last before he noticed the gifts were missing?",

He walks down the hallway.\nSuddenly, his Chettiar senses start ringing\u2014a deep, instinctive feeling that something unusual is wrong. It feels as though a chipmunk is poking his brain, warning him of danger. Captain C pauses, his eyes narrowing as he studies the door he has just crossed by.\nThe name on the door reads Jiapei.\nAswin \nThis name was there last year as well.

This key mechanically shapeshifts and then can open any door. Aswin opens the door and is met by an extremely messy dorm room with nobody inside. Aswin walks inside, inspecting the room.\n\nAswin \nStill not as messy as Negha\u2019s room. Subramani, any update?\n\nSubramani \nI\u2019m trying. The name Jiapei isn\u2019t on either list, Naughty or Nice.\n\nAswin \nInteresting. \n\nAswin walks to the desk on the right side of the room. Many papers and files are messily spread across the table. Aswin leans closer to inspect the papers.\n\nAswin \nThat\u2019s odd.\n\nAll the papers are filled with text. However, all of the text is just multiple assortments of ones and zeroes. There are hundreds of pages of paper on the table, all with just ones and zeroes inscribed upon them.",

Subramani works to decipher the binary text using ASCII, forming letters and then words from the binary numbers. Aswin, in the meantime, watches reels. \n\nSubramani \nCaptain, you\u2019re not going to like this.\n\nAswin\nWhat is it?\n\nSubramani \nThese are pages and pages of notes on Sanjana, Priya, Negha, and Sai dating back to last semester.

Her face is moving mechanically as she scans him.\n\nAswin launches forward to deliver a punch to Jiapei\u2019s neck. Aswin\u2019s fist is met with a metal clank. Aswin clutches his hand, dancing in pain.\n\nAswin \nYou\u2019re not even a person\u2026 you\u2019re a\u2026a\u2026robot?\nShe kicks him in the chest, knocking him back, then sweeps his legs out from under him.
