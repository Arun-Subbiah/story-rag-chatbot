He leans on the railing, admiring the river that flows as gentle as a falling feather.\nAswin Voice Over\nI am a Chettiar. One of the last Chettiars alive. We are a family. And with a family comes traditions.\n\nThere existed a council of Chettiars. The chettiar council consisted of the most powerful and wise Chettiars, ruling over the clan. The council guarded the ancient Chettiar rock, protecting it from getting in the wrong hands. They were the masters of fight and they were extremely skilled in the Chettiar arts. All the villages were ruled by this council. When a member of the council passes away, the next strongest and wisest Chettiar is elected in the council by all the villages. The last council all died in the tragedy of 2001.",

The Chettiars won the war, eliminating the rebels and restoring peace in the Burma land.\n\nAs the Chettiar Council was traveling back across the sea, a storm attacked. The council was in grave danger, trapped in the middle of a dangerous natural disaster.\n\nStranded at Sea.\n\nEach of the days they were stranded at sea, they prayed to lord Ganesha, begging for a safe journey back home. When they prayed, they plucked out a string from their veshtis and placed it near the Pilayar statue. The council did this to keep track of the days lost at sea. \n\nAfter 21 days, a mysterious phenomenon occurred that helped navigate the council back to the Chettiar Region. Till this day, nobody knows what exactly happened. Many assume the power of Pilayar helped bring the Chettiars back home safely.",
