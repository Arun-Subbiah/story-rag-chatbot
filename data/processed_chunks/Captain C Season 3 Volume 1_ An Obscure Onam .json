It\u2019s already past 12am. \n\nAswin finishes typing his lab report and briefly closes his laptop to take a break. He takes out his phone and then watches a few reels. Suddenly, a faint sound echoes from outside, near the Purdue Arch. Aswin looks out the window.\n\n\u201cWe are SAATH\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are SAATH\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are SAATH\u201d\n\nAswin smiles. A group of boys and girls chant \u201cWe are SAATH\u201d as they cross Grant St and post their posters on the lampposts. \n\nAswin \nThinking \nA mental health group targeting the South Asian Community\u2026 What an awesome idea!",

He drinks some water, ties his shoes, packs up his things, and starts to head out the building. Aswin puts his copy of the Chettiar Prophecy in the second compartment of his bag. He crosses the street, and as he does, from the corner of his eye he spots the SAATH poster on the black lamppost.\n\nAswin walks up to the poster and reads: \u201cWe are SAATH launches a new student run political party: The SAATH Party. We will be contesting in the Purdue Student Government Presidential Elections\u201d \n\nAswin \nSaath in politics? This race will definitely be interesting to watch.

Where are her friends?\n\nNegha runs to a nearby man. \n\nNegha\nSir, where am I? What park is this?\n\nThe man slowly turns around. He takes his sunglasses off to reveal his face.\n\nHisham creepily smiles at Negha. \n\nNegha screams in deep fear and runs away. She runs to a nearby woman.\n\nNegha \nMa\u2019am, help me!
