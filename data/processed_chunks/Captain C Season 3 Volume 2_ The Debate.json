Crime rates have dropped and Aswin has not often had to take on the mantle of Captain C. \n\nAswin \nThinking \nWhy is she taking so long!\n\nAswin walks up from the chair and goes to the counter of the service desk. There he picks up a volume of the Exponent. \n\nThursday, September 26. Yesterday\u2019s paper. \n\nThe headlines were the usual.

The newspaper details that multiple parties have been dealing with this issue. The newspaper marks this as a rise in drug trafficking within West Lafayette. The newspaper states that police have no idea where this sudden surge in drug imports is coming from. \n\nThe author of the article asks the same question that Aswin has ringing in his mind: Is there a new big player or supplier in the drug market in West Lafayette, the next after Nidarshan?",

Purdue should implement better lighting in key areas, especially near party zones. We could also establish more visible patrols and create a campus-wide program with local authorities to monitor parties. Proactive measures like these make it easier for students to focus on enjoying their time rather than constantly worrying about safety.\n\nThe crowd bursts into applause.
