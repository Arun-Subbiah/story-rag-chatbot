A banner hangs above her head, reading: \u201cJubail Toastmasters Club.\u201d \n\nSai Aiswarya scans the crowd, looking for her parents. Her parents sit in the second row. Her dad has a video camera in hand. Her mom sits beside, encouraging Sai Aiswarya with her eyes. \n\nMom \nWhispering \nYou can do this!\n\nSai Aiswarya smiles. Her mother\u2019s words of encouragement are her golden potion of motivation. Now, she has all the confidence to rock the stage. \n\nSai Aiswarya looks down at herself. She is dressed in a silver-blue outfit with a pink skirt and pink leggings. Purple wings expand from both of her sides. Above her forehead lies the mask of a unicorn.",

A row behind, and a few seats to the right sits a very familiar face: Manjula Sridhar. \n\nSai Aiswarya smiles at Manjula Sridhar. But Manjula Sridhar does not smile back. Sai Aiswarya\u2019s smile falters. The air, once warm and pleasant, is slowly freezing. \n\nManjula Sridhar\u2019s face remains eerily still, and her eyes lock into Sai Aiswarya\u2019s eyes with terror. Manjula Sridhar\u2019s lips curl into a wide and eerie grin, and her teeth sharpen into knives. Her eyes slowly darken, before fully turning blood red. \n\nSai Aiswarya is breathless, scared, lost. Manjula Sridhar starts to scream in a wail of fury, at the top of her lungs. The crowd is oblivious. \n\nSai Aiswarya begins to cry, tears flowing like a waterfall down her cheek.",

Sai Aiswarya plunges into a deep abyss, falling and falling and falling without hitting the ground. Everything around her is dark and hollow. The wind rushes past her and there is no bottom- just an endless plunge into nothing. And through this fall, she hears a low, distorted voice- laughing. \n\nSai Aiswarya bolts up from her bed, her heart hammering in her chest. She gasps for air as the creepy laughter still echoes through her ears. She frantically looks around her room, making sure she is safe from the horrors of the nightmare. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCaptain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
