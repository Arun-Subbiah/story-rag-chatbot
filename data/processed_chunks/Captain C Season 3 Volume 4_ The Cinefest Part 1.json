Meanwhile, Negha is talking to some of the independent performers about their upcoming performances.\n\nThe whole hall is radiating with palpable joy and energy. The far walls are lined up with movie posters, from Ghilli to Manchithrazhu. An archery booth and multiple exciting games are also set up. The hall is set up in a red theme, giving it a fun and movie red carpet like vibe. \n\nThe performances begin! First a North Indian girl dances to songs from all South Indian languages. Next, a girl seductively sings Oo Antava while her friend sensually dances to the song. \n\nMeanwhile, Aswin is serving rose milk at the food table. At a distance away from  him, two girls are approaching the table. \n\nRaechel Davids\nLet\u2019s get rose milk!\n\nMala\nOoh sounds tasty!\n\nThe girls stylishly walk up to Aswin. Aswin starts to pour the rose milk into the two cups. \n\nAswin \nHow are you both doing? Have a very nice day",

As Raechel Davids grasps her hand around the cup, a stick-on red fingernail extension attached to her nail falls and hits the floor. In the commotion, Raechel Davids drops the entire cup.\n\nRaechel Davids\nOops! These nails are so bad, always falling off. I need to get higher quality ones!\n\nAswin \nWould you like another cup? Have a very nice day!\n\nRaechel Davids \nNo that\u2019s alright\n\nAswin \nHave a very nice day\n\nRaechel Davids and Mala walk away gossiping. Negha walks by and stands next to Aswin.\n\nAswin \nWell that was odd\n\nNegha\nYeah it was \n\nNegha is suddenly alarmed as she notices something on Aswin.\n\nNegha\nAswin!

We have put a lot of hard work and effort into this dance with weekly practices, choreographed by our vice president Negha. We hope you enjoy it!\n\nNegha runs over from the rose milk stand to the side of the stage. Aswin holds up his phone to record the performance before the stage. The music starts to fill up the ballroom. Illuminati starts blaring\u2026.\n\n\u2026",

Suddenly a scream is heard from across the room. \n\nAswin quickly puts the phone back in his pocket and races across the room to see what the commotion is all about.\n\nA boy is on the floor and a cup of spilled rose milk is right beside him. His friend is panicking, trying to wake him up.\n\nAswin \nHey! Young man are you alright!\n\nBoy \nHe was just drinking this rose milk, and instantly fainted as he was walking. \n\nAswin observes around the room. Multiple people are passed out on to tables, their faces meeting the table. They all have cups of rose milk beside them.\n\nNegha runs up to the scene. \n\nAswin \nThe rose milk! It must have been spiked! \n\nNegha\nWho could this be!?\n\nAswin \nI don\u2019t know\u2026 Wait!
