Welcome to Vijayadashami! Everyone can start lining up for food now. \n\nHordes of students race from their seats and to the food line. Raechel Davids leads the pack. The scene resembles a stampede of thirsty elephants racing to a nearby lake. \n\nNegha\nWell look at them go\n\nAswin \nI know right, have a very nice day \n\nNegha \nAswin!

Aswin is distracted by watching reels on his phone. Negha opens up a bag.

Inside, there are multiple red and blue wires connected to a main circuit box. The box has a display that reads a countdown: 2 hours to go. \n\nNegha\nIs it a boba maker?",

Aswin\u2019s hands tremble as he clutches the scissor. \n\nAswin\nThinking \nWhy am I so dizzy?\n\nAswin cuts one of the two wires, and the timer on the display disappears.\n\nAswin \nIt\u2019s defused!",
