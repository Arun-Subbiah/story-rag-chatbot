She is the strongest witch in the underworld! An expert in dark magic! The whole purpose of her election was to construct a lair for her dangerous concoctions, under the guise of a new residence hall. It\u2019s their new capital for taking over the world. Niki wants to destroy. Nidarshan wanted power. They formed an alliance so Nidarshan could gain power using Niki\u2019s ability to destroy. These bombs have more range of destruction due to Niki\u2019s dark magic that has been infused inside the bombs. Even right this second, she is brewing more and more in the lair\u2026.\n\nSai Aiswarya\nWe have to go to the lair and stop Niki!\n\nRaechel Davids\nWhat! She\u2019s not in the lair!
