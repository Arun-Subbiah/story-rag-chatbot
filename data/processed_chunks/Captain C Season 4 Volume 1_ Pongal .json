    "text": "Summer, 2024. \n\nAswin Chidambaram Kumar hurriedly drags a large black bag through the tangled light green grass and yellow weeds of a remote field in Columbus, Indiana. The night is pitch black and silent, with the exception of crickets that hum to the melody of nature. Stars are scattered across the sky like drops of white paint flung upon a black canvas. Aswin reaches the center of the large field and puts down the bag. The bag is so large, it rivals Aswin\u2019s own size. \n\nAswin zips open the bag and steadily takes out the heavy instrument within the bag. A large box-like machine with wires connected all around flattens the grass beneath it. At the top of this machine lies a connected circular component that appears like a shining disk with a hollow inner circle. Suddenly Aswin\u2019s phone rings. It\u2019s his manager from Cummins. \n\nJosh \nAswin, are you all set?\n\nAswin \nYes, I\u2019m all ready sir. Hope you're having a nice night. Let me connect to the network.",

Let me connect to the network. \n\nAswin retrieves his laptop from his bag and connects to his phone\u2019s hotspot. He logs into the Cummins VPN and accesses the Cummins network. \n\nAswin\nI'm in, sir. \n\nJosh \nExcellent. Now Aswin, this is the last stage to the project you have been working on all these past months in your Co-op. This is the final test. All you have to do is shoot a random beam into the sky. Let\u2019s see if it works. \n\nAswin nods.\n\nAswin switches to a new screen on his laptop. In the center of the screen lies a button that reads \u2018deploy.\u2019 Aswin hesitantly clicks the button.\n\nAswin \nOhm Namhashivaya\n\nSuddenly, the machine starts making a whirring noise. The disk on the top of the machine turns light blue and slowly starts rotating.\n\nJosh \nA good start\u2026",

The light blue is glowing even more fiercely. Aswin begins to back away. \n\nSuddenly, the machine shoots a silent white beam into the distant sky. Aswin\u2019s fear morphs into a triumphant smile of joy and accomplishment.\n\nAswin jumps in the air in joy with his arms and legs spread out.\n\nAswin \nI did it!\n\nJosh \nExcellent work Aswin. Please turn in the reactor to the plant office tomorrow. Safe to say, you can expect a job here for next summer. \n\nAswin \nThank you sir, have a very nice night.\n\nThe camera slowly zooms into Aswin\u2019s brave and remarkably sharp eyes, and then fades into: \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

The guests of the event are captured by the smell and can not control their urges.

The camera trails a muscular young man in slow motion, who stylishly removes his grey tommy hilfiger coat.

All the girls in the room turned in his direction and swooned at the sight of him. \u201cHe\u2019s so handsome,\u201d one girl squeals. The camera captures his hair waving in the air in slow motion, and then cuts to his sharp bold eyes, which could pop a balloon with just a brief glance. He smiles and displays his flashy white pearls, which could be mistaken for the bright flash of a camera. The man spins into the kitchen and leans against the counter.",
