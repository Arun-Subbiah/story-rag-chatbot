Two student workers, a girl and a boy, sit behind the desk, bored out of their minds. The camera focuses on the relaxed scene of the lobby, with people passing. Suddenly, the girl notices a shift in the air. \n\nGirl \nHey, do you feel that?\n\nBoy \nWhat? \n\nGirl \nI\u2019m.. I\u2019m getting goosebumps\u2026 \n\nBoy \nWait, I\u2019m feeling it too\u2026 there\u2019s just this aura\u2026\n\nHeroic music begins to play. The camera focuses on the automatic sliding doors, which open in slow motion. Behind the doors stands a man in sunglasses. \n\nAswin Chidambaram Kumar stylishly walks in and sits down in the chairs opposite to the front desk, where the students behind the counter watch him with saliva seeping from the corners of their mouths.\n\nGirl \nHe\u2019s just so handsome! \n\nAswin notices the girl staring at him. Aswin quickly turns his head and winks at the girl. The girl falls out of her chair.",

The event is scheduled for April 20th. Colleges across the nation are in awe of SIA\u2019s success.\n\nAswin smiles. He flips to the second page. The headline reads: Purdue Theatre Director Reports UFO sighting.

Many have ridiculed her and doubt the validity to her claims. Many members of the cast of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d, such as star actress Negha Sethuramalingam and costar Donovan Hibbeln have considered leaving the production in light of these claims.\u201d",

Once they are all gone, Aswin begins to speak. \n\n\nAswin \nEveryone, I have a new announcement to make. I would like to introduce our newest SIA Guardian\u2026.\n\nThe SIA Guardians feet start to dance in anticipation. This news from their esteemed captain is very surprising. \n\nAswin \nArthi! \n\nArthi climbs out from beneath the table and makes her way over to a chair. \n\nAswin \nHi there Arthi, hope you\u2019re having a nice day.\n\nThe SIA Guardians clap their hands, which create a harmony of hope.",

She hovers in the air and rises up all the way to the top of the room, just below the large circular chandelier. Rings of gold magic appear from mid-air and surround her, doing loops around her entranced body. The magic of the chettiar condenses and seeps within her, turning her eyes gold. Then, she slowly returns to the ground and shivers as she regains consciousness on top of the table. \n\n\n\nAswin \nWelcome to the SIA Guardians!
