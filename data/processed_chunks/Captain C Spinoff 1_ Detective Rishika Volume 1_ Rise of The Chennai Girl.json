It glistens and radiates power, representing both the energy of creation and the fury of destruction. \n\nThe camera slowly zooms out. The red forms a perfect circle- a pottu, resting confidently in the center of her forehead. The camera moves even further back, revealing her sharp eyes. Her eyes shift from left to right like a pendulum. \n\nRishika is sitting at her desk, typing up a report in google docs. Suddenly, her phone rings. Rishika looks at her phone, and smiles. She picks up the phone.\n\nRishika \nHey, how are you? \n\nFriend\nPretty good! Are you in Chennai?\n\nRishika\nUnfortunately not. I\u2019m staying back for winter break.\n\nFriend\nOh no! Why is that?\n\nRishika\nCaptain C is on leave. He\u2019s gone on a trip to Singapore. I have to stay back and cover for him.",

Rishika checks the time. 11:40pm She knocks on a door on the ground floor. \n\nKnock, Knock\n\nRishika\nRishika, college Detective \n\nThe door frantically swings open. A man of age 40 opens the door. His expression is aghast and his hair is all shaken up. He is dressed in a nice red sweater. His eyes are sunken, as if he has been crying for hours. \n\nStranger\nRishika! I\u2019m John. John Schmidt. \n\nRishika\nMr. Schmidt. Take me to where you heard the commotion! \n\nJohn \nIt was just out here. She was taking trash to the dumpster near the bus stop, but something happened midway.

The living room is perfectly arranged, not a cushion out of place. The kitchen counters gleam, free of even a speck of dust, and the trash can is free of a trash bag. In the bedroom, the bed is made with crisp, precise folds. Every corner of the house is eerily immaculate, leaving no hint of a struggle or anything amiss.\n\nRishika \nNeat house you got there\n\nJohn chuckles slightly \nRishika\u2019s eyes narrow as she inspects the dining table, its surface sparkling clean. She runs a hand over the surface of the table. Something feels off. She crouches down, her heart pounding, and peers beneath. In the shadow, near the far leg of the table, she spots it\u2014a small box. She pulls it out, her hands trembling.\n Inside are 12 glistening green grapes.",
