The dragon was called the three horned guardian, or the guardian for short. The dragon accompanied the ninjas in battle across the land. \n\nHowever, a group of misfit ninjas diverged from the original group, and created a separate sect: the rebels. Their goal was to ruin the peace and democracy maintained by the ninjas, and rule the entirety of Japan by themselves.\n\nThe rebels and ninjas fought countless wars over control for Japan. In the final war, also known as the Great War, the dragon delivered the final blow on the rebels, using all its strength and might. The rebels were eliminated. \n\nHowever, with this last effort, the dragon was reduced to ashes, leaving behind just one part:\n\nThe Dragon Skull.",
