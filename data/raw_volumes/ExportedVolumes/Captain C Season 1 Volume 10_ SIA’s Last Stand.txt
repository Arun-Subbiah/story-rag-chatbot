Captain C Season 1 Volume 10
Setting: AAARCC basement, Captain C/SIA headquarters. SIA board members including Negha are buried in homework. Suddenly, the door knocks upstairs and the friends perk up. 

Negha
Let me go get that 

Hitha
Wait! We have to be careful. Our safety is at risk 

Aadit grabs a nearby remote and presses a green button. Suddenly a tv display emerges down from the ceiling. Aadit clicks another button and a live camera feed displays the front door. Aswin is standing there waiting for the door to be opened.

Rishika
Oh! It’s Aswin 

Negha
Why is he back? 

Rishika
I don’t know… wait! What if it’s the clone!

Hitha
Look at the axes in his hands!!

The gang’s eyes widened with fear.  

Negha
Oh no what do we do? They said he’s a.. a..

Aadit 
Killing machine.

Camera cuts to Agent C outside the building waiting at the front door. He twirls the axes around as he whistles a soft, quirky tune. Suddenly, he kicks down the door. Agent C strolls around the main floor counter clockwise, moving from the tv room, to the empty dining table, to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he makes himself a cup of rose milk and moves to the living room where he sits down on the couch with his legs crossed. He sips the rose milk at a snail’s pace.

Cut to the basement, where the gang is hiding behind a bunch of boxes that belong to the tea appreciation club. They are quietly hyperventilating, trying to not make a single noise while at the same, are in the most perilous situation of their lives. Negha wipes a tear. 

Sai Aiswarya
Whispering 
This is traumatizing 

Camera cuts to Agent C. He finishes his rose milk and sets the empty glass on the table in front, next to the large bowl of origami cranes. He stands up, sighs, and tucks the axes in his pockets. He then pulls out a black box with a red wire and a green wire running across each end of the box. There is some double sided tape on the top of the box. He attaches the box to the underside of the couch and strolls out the building. 

As Agent C strolls down 5th street, he whistles to the tune of a famous Ilaiyaraaja song(Rajaathi Raja). As he turns the corner onto the next street, a giant explosion goes off behind him, destroying the AAARCC and the nearby cultural centers surrounding it, killing all life within the bomb’s radius.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cut to Hawkin’s secret basement, or the cloning lab. Arun and Priya hide behind a pillar and glimpse at a scientific lab with a machine at the far end. They watch as Jason 3 operates the machine, noticing various life forms in test tubes connected to the machine, with percentage signs displayed in front of each one. The test tubes are filled with a bubbling, glowing liquid, and engulfed in the liquid are emerging life forms.

Arun 
Whispering 
Clones…

Priya nods 

Suddenly, a cold hand reaches out and grips Arun's shoulder. A jolt of fear seeps through Arun, and he jumps, heart racing as he spins around to confront the unknown presence lurking behind him.

Reveal: It is Jason 

However, this Jason looks very different to the other two Arun and Priya have seen over the course of the day. This Jason has heavy bruises all around his face and his clothes are tattered. His face is extremely sunken, as if he has not slept in days. 

Jason
Whispering 
Save me…

Arun and Priya stare, realizing that this must be the real Jason. The Jason upstairs and the Jason operating the machine must be clones. 

Priya 
Whispering
Let’s take him down 

Arun 
Whispering 
Are you sure? Should we wait it out and get instructions from Captain C?

Priya moves out past the pillar and slowly begins walking towards Jason 3. As she is walking, she accidentally steps on a glass test tube and it shatters. Jason 3 quickly turns around in surprise and stares down Priya. Priya charges towards Jason 3 and grabs him by the hand, flips him across the nearby table, and stomps his chest, breaking the table as Jason 3 falls to the floor. Jason 3 wails in pain. Priya takes out her sword from her sheath and points it at Jason 3. 

Arun and Jason run over to the scene. Arun, Priya, and Jason surround Jason 3. Priya turns toward Jason. 

Priya 
Would you like to explain just what is going on? Why are there so many clones? What is Project C? And who is in charge of all this?

Jason 
Weakly
I have your answers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to a room in one of the top floors of Hawkins. Aswin glances around, his eyes drawn to a machine that emits an unsettling mechanical whirring. The display ominously reads: Project C: 30 minutes : 99%. In the faint light, a man in a suit stands by the window, gazing out at the fading sunset over the PMU, a shadowy silhouette against the glowing sky. 

Aswin
Thinking
It’s him. The king of criminal activity of West Lafayette. 

Camera pointed to the man’s back as the man slowly turned around. As he turns around, he adjusts his glasses but his face is still not revealed. 

Camera moves from the man’s back to Aswin’s shocked face. Aswin is unable to process what he is seeing

Aswin
Stuttering
It can’t…It can’t….It can’t be….

Camera is zoomed in on the mysterious man’s lips as it curls into a nefarious, sly smile. The camera zooms out to reveal the man’s face…

Aswin 
Nidarshan. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to the cloning lab in the basement. Jason 3 is blacked out from Priya’s attack. Arun, Priya, and Jason are standing around Jason 3.

Priya 
Nidarshan? 

Arun 
The guy in the suit?

Priya
I can’t believe it. I just won’t believe it. Someone so close to us. He’s in SIA, a board member too…

Jason 
Well you better believe it. He’s the kingpin. Nidarshan is the ruler of the West Lafayette underworld crime syndicate. He owns a massive underground drug network. 

Arun 
How do you know all this? How are you involved?

Jason 
I was working in my lab on my personal research project in the Purdue research lab. The project was about cloning. 

Jason points at the machine. 

Jason
This project is right here. It was Nidarshan who came up to me and asked me to join in on Project C. He said he noticed my work and needed a bright mind like me. When I declined, realizing how dangerous it was, he kidnapped me. He used my own project to make clones of myself. One clone to infiltrate SIA and work on the cloning project. This guy right here. 

Jason eyes Jason 3

Jason 
The other clone to work on Project C upstairs 

Arun 
So those ten kids who were kidnapped, along with Sanjana. They were all kidnapped to work on project C?

Jason
No… they were taken to be cloned, so their clones could work on Project C. You see, these clones can be genetically and mentally modified. You can change their physical characteristics, as well as their personal motivations. All of this cloning work is just to serve as a support. A backbone for Project C. 

Priya 
So what exactly is Project C?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to a dorm room in one of the top floors of Hawkins, the headquarters of Nidarshan. Aswin and Nidarshan stare at each other face to face. Aswin is trying to mask his shocked expression, while Nidarshan greets Aswin with an evil, twisted, sly smile. 


Nidarshan
Ah Agent C, you’re just in time. Project C is ready to launch. 

Aswin remains silent and tries to keep his face as emotionless as Agent C.

Nidarshan walks over to the display. The display flickers from 99% to a bright 100%, signaling that the final processes are complete. With a satisfied grin, he activates the machine, and a soft whirring sound fills the room. The mechanical components and gears start spinning and lights flash in sync with the display. Suddenly, a small, glowing orb emerges from the machine, pulsating with energy. Nidarshan carefully retrieves it and places it in a slot of a larger apparatus nearby. The larger device’s mechanical pieces shift and slide, interlocking seamlessly as it transforms into a giant mechanical chair. The chair has mechanical components and a padded seat with a display panel that shows real-time system diagnostics. Small turbines are attached to both sides of the massive chair and in the back of the chair, a glowing orb is attached to the back. 

Aswin is stunned. He has never seen something so technologically advanced in his life.

Aswin 
What…what is it…?

Nidarshan turns back to face Aswin and Jason 2. 

Nidarshan
Ah I forgot Agent C, you are new to our group.

Aswin nods, uncomfortably

Nidarshan 
Now, the power of time… Is in the palm of my hands.

Aswin 
A…a…time machine?

Nidarshan 
Yes, my boy. Now I can not only travel to the past, but also into the future. 

Aswin’s widen in terror

Aswin 
You’ve already traveled to the past? 

Nidarshan
The first model of my time machine was completed last year, but it could only travel to the past. After one excellent trip, the machine burned out, proving time travel isn't sustainable with current technology. I realized I needed advanced stabilizers and amplifiers from the future, or else the machine would burn out after one use. To build a machine that could get to the future, I cloned the brightest minds at Purdue, including Jason here. Those other clones I threw away after getting their help. I also took Sanjana with the aim of eliminating her. The role of SIA president is mine! 

Nidarshan Sighs


Nidarshan 
With this machine, I'll make one trip to the future to retrieve the necessary parts, allowing me to come back and upgrade my machine. I can then travel freely across timelines an unlimited number of times. With the ability to go into the future, imagine how much money I can make. I will always be one step ahead of my enemies. 

Aswin 
Why…Why was your one trip to the past excellent? What did you do…

Nidarshan smiles maliciously and turns away from Aswin

Nidarshan 
That was quite the tale, boy. I once lived in a world where the Chettiars were guardians, thwarting crime everywhere. They were the protectors of this world. Every time my business took a step forward or my trafficking circle expanded, a Chettiar would shut it down. I spent countless nights in jail, haunted by their presence. I dreaded them—every single one—yet I could never eliminate any of them. They were simply too powerful! I needed a way to get rid of all of them at once. 

Aswin's expression shifts from disbelief to horror, his eyes widening as the weight of Nidarshan's revelation sinks in. 

Aswin 
Stammering
So you.. So you… you did what?

Nidarshan 
I started Project Chettiar - a time machine to go back and wipe out all the chettiars out all at once, before they migrated all over the world. I traveled to the Chettiar region in 2001 and placed a massive bomb that destroyed the chettiar region. I disguised it as a meteor disaster with some local government help -bribing them was so easy!

Nidarshan turns towards Aswin 

Nidarshan 
But somehow, one chettiar survived. Captain C, they called him. The last chettiar- the last surviving chettiar. And he almost put a stop to me again! That was until I had my own Captain C on my side. Or shall I say, Agent C. I needed a Chettiar to defeat a Chettiar. 

Nidarshan triumphantly puts his hand on Aswin’s shoulder. Aswin is trembling in rage. His entire heritage, his chettiar clan, people like him, were all wiped out by the man standing in front of him.  

Suddenly a phone rings from Nidarshan’s pocket. Nidarshan takes his hand off Aswin’s shoulder and walks towards the machine while taking the phone out of his pocket. He stares at the machine in awe while enamored with child-like joy as he picks up the phone without reading who is calling. 

On the phone, it is the real Agent C. 

Agent C
Boss, I tracked down where their headquarters is. I placed a bomb that could go off any minute now. SIA is about to be done for. 

Nidarshan
Startled
Agent C? Then who is…

Nidarshan quickly turns around and comes face to face with Captain C.

Aswin makes a hand gesture up and down that points towards himself. 

Aswin 
Captain C Da…

Nidarshan’s expression shifts from bewilderment to complete rage. Every measurable centimeter of his face emits unmeasurable anger.  

Aswin 
SANJANA, Now!

Sanjana kicks down the door, sending it crashing to the floor. Sanjna heroically blows a strand of hair off her face as she heroically stands through the doorway. 

Suddenly a faint explosion noise is heard from outside. Everyone glances outside and notices a dark cloud of dust rising from past the belltower. 

Aswin and Sanjana
No!

Tears begin to stream down the faces of Aswin and Sanjana. Nidarshan watches with a straight face. 

Sanjana
Those are my friends! 

With a burst of energy, Aswin lunges at Nidarshan, landing a solid punch that sends him staggering back. Sanjana follows suit, her emotions boiling over as she charges at Jason 2, her kick connecting with his chest and forcing him to the ground. Jason 2 is knocked out. 

Nidarshan punches back at Aswin, forcing Aswin to fall to the ground. Aswin quickly does a flip to recover, and then faces Nidarshan with a fighting stance. Sanjana grabs Nidarshan’s arms, restricting his motion. Aswin delivers multiple punches to Nidarshan, blacking him out. 

Sanjana stomps Nidarshan and crosses her arms

Sanjana
As she looks down at Nidarshan 
“I am the SIA president”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to outside of Hawkins, in the round about pick up space behind Hawkins. The sky is now pitch black. Arun, Aswin, Sanjana, Priya, and Jason watch as the police escort Nidarshan, Jason 2, and Jason 3 into a high security police vehicle. 

Priya
All our friends are gone. 

Sanjana wipes away a tear. 

Sanjana
Arun’s gif in the dance group chat was true all along 

Priya
It’s over 

Aswin 
Nothing is over until we say it's over. We can save them. 

Arun turns toward Aswin and stares.

Arun 
The time machine!

Aswin nods 


Jason 
But how would we even go about doing this? We only have one trip available, as the machine burns out after one use. 

Aswin 
That’s why we have a decision to make on how to use it. Three choices. 

Arun, Priya, Sanjana, and Jason sit on a nearby bench while Aswin stands. 

Aswin 
One option is to continue Nidarshan’s plan. We can go to the future and get the required parts. Or we can get a perfectly working futuristic time machine model and use it. This way we can travel as many times as we want to since we would have a working model. Even if we mess up, we can just try again. 

Arun
But how would we know how far to go into the future? Rebuilding the machine would be complicated. Nidarshan had eleven of the brightest minds of Purdue. We only have Jason.

Aswin 
True. Option 2 is we go back to 2001 and stop Nidarshan from eliminating the Chettiars. A world with Chettiars as protectors would stop the emergence of criminal masterminds like Nidarshan. This bomb would not exist, Agent C wouldn’t exist, Project C wouldn’t exist.

Priya
That’s still a risk. What if we don’t defeat Nidarshan in the past? What if we mistime our arrival in the past and end up losing? Then when we come back, all our friends would still be gone. 

Aswin nods

Aswin 
The third option is to travel back one hour ago. Go to AAARCC and stop Agent C from killing our friends. Simultaneously, the version of ourselves at that time would still be defeating Nidarshan like we just did now. When we return, our friends would remain unharmed while Nidarshan still gets put behind bars. One shot to stop him. 

Jason 
I prefer Option 1. With a time machine from the future, imagine all we could do and research. An extremely advanced high technology device in our very hands. Imagine all the money by selling the machine. Our names would get engraved into every science and history book! Then we can still go back and save your friends. 



Sanjana
No! What if we can’t find anything in the future? What if we don’t go farther enough into the future, and end up in a time where time travel is not invented yet. 

Priya
Or what if we go too far! What if society becomes dystopian and time travel is banned! 

Arun 
I don’t think we can take that risk. But thinking about it, imagine a world full of Chettiars. Imagine how safe we would be. The entire course of history would be different. With this machine in our hands, we could bring our family back.

Arun looks up at the sky 

Arun 
However, family isn’t just defined by blood. It’s a term built through bonding and support. It’s the love we have for each other. 

Aswin 
I agree. We can’t risk the lives of our friends for the hope of worldwide scientific recognition or some relatives to come back to life. My friends have helped me become stronger and more resilient. They've stood by me in my darkest moments, helping me to see that I'm never truly alone. They are not just my friends; they are my family. It’s our duty to save them. 

Arun, Priya, and Sanjana nod in agreement. Jason also nods in agreement. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to Nidarshan’s headquarters. Aswin presses a button on the machine and the machine folds into a suitcase. Aswin brings the suitcase downstairs and outside of Hawkins. He opens it up and the suitcase again turns into a time machine. Aswin, Arun, Priya, Sanjana, and Jason surround the time machine. Aswin approaches the display and turns the clock back one hour backwards. They all squeeze into the chair. 

Aswin 
For SIA

Arun, Priya, Sanjana, and Jason 
For SIA

Aswin presses the ‘go’ button. The wind started to blow. The machine started to spin. In a flash, the machine and the gang disappeared. Then everything was still. Absolutely still.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The machine lands with a loud thud. The gang looks around dazed, but they feel that nothing has changed. Everything around them looks the same. However, it is no longer dark. The sun is still setting. 

Aswin looks at his watch 

Aswin 
We’re here. One hour in the past.

Aswin looks up at the top of Hawkins.

Aswin 
And the other me must be up there right this moment 

Aswin looks forward 

Aswin 
No time to waste. Let’s run! 

The gang nods and sprints across Mitch Daniels Blvd, through PMU, past the bell tower, and near 5th street. 

Sanjana 
Look! It’s Agent C!

Agent C is walking past the hall of Nursing and is about to merge on 5th street. The gang follows him while maintaining a distance. He reaches the AAARCC. The camera shifts to focus on his hands, gripping a massive ax in each hand. With deliberate slowness, he ascends the steps of the AAARCC, each footfall echoing like a foreboding heartbeat.
As the camera moves up to his face, a chilling smile spreads across his lips, revealing a murderous intent.
Aswin 
Stop!

Agent C turns around and meets Aswin’s stern eyes. 

Aswin 
You’re going to have to get through me- us- first!

Agent C walks back down the steps as Arun, Aswin, Sanjana, Priya, and Jason surround him. Agent C realizes that this fight will be harder than the last one at the research lab. He reaches to his phone and makes a quick call. 

Agent C
I’m going to need backup 

Voice on phone 
I’ll send in troops. Anything for our leader Nidarshan.

Agent C puts the phone back in the pocket. The remaining SIA members are facing Agent C in the middle of 5th street. Agent C then puts on a fighting stance, daring the SIA guardians to come forward to fight. 
	
Priya McNamara strikes first, unsheathing and slashing her sword at Agent C all in one motion. Agent C ducks under and is met with a kick from Sanjana. He is unflinched, grabs her leg, and flips her over. Arun charges at Agent C, only to be met by a punch that flies Arun back 10 feet. Aswin loosens his fists and runs into Agent C with a punch. Agent C blocks one punch, takes the impact of the other, and sweep kicks Aswin falls to the ground. Agent C is the only one standing. Jason watches from a distance, scared by what he has just seen.

Jason 
We’re no match for Agent C. He’s just too strong.

Aswin, Arun, Priya, and Sanjana rise from the ground and continue to throw their attacks. Their fight goes on, but the four combined are still no match for Agent C. The fight continues for what seems like an endless amount of time. 

Suddenly, a deep rumbling sound filled the air, like a herd of charging rhinos thundering closer with every second. The ground began rumbling. Aswin turns his head. In the distance, an army of men with something on their head are charging towards them down the street. Aswin squints his eyes. 

Aswin
Wait… Is that…

As the men get closer, it is revealed that they are all wearing turbans and are sporting beards. 

Aswin turns to Agent C

Aswin 
Is that the Sikh Student Association? SSA?

Agent C smiles

Agent C
Nidarshan’s loyal supporters. They make up his army. Now I am their captain. 

The army starts getting closer. Arun, Aswin, Priya, Sanjana, and Jason watch in shock, wondering how they will ever be able to get out of this situation alive. 

Jason
We’re done for. All of us are going to die.

Suddenly, the AAARCC door swings open. The gang quickly turns and looks back at the door. A girl’s black puma shoe steps out. As she walks out, the camera moves from her black puma shoes, to the marudhani tattoos across her arm, to the chemistry textbook clutched in her hand. The camera finally focuses on her face.

 It is Sai Aiswarya. She wears a mean and confident expression.

After she walks down the stairs, Rishika and Negha spiritedly walk out with laptops clutched in their hands. They seem extremely brave and their eyes are as sharp as an eagle. Aadit and Hitha follow behind them. Aadit valiantly holds his skateboard in a fighting stance. Hitha clutches her laptop in her hand and flips her hair to the back. Sai Aiswarya, Negha, Rishika, Aadit, and Hitha line up in front of the AAARCC. 

Sai Aiswarya
How long did you guys think we were going to be on the sidelines?

Negha
It’s our time to shine. We no longer sulk in fear. It’s time to prove that we are also warriors. 

The group of 5 lines up alongside Aswin, Arun, Priya, and Sanjana. Jason stands up and joins alongside. They form a line and aim their weapons and fists at the army of Sikhs storming towards them. 

SIA 
All at once
We are the protectors of Purdue, a force against evil driven by the power of friendship. WE ARE SIA!

Agent C shoots a furious glare as the army finally arrives, their footsteps echoing like a storm. They surge past Agent C, hiding his figure as they continue their relentless charge forward.

Aswin glances at Arun 

Arun smiles back

Aswin 
It’s Chettiar time! 



The SIA vs SSA WAR

A group of Punjabis crowd Aadit and Hitha. Aadit takes his skateboard and smacks it across the head of multiple Sikhs at once. He uses his skateboard as a weapon to take down multiple enemies. The sikhs fall to the ground in pain. Hitha uses her laptop to spin around and take down multiple enemies at once. Hitha jumps and kicks another enemy as he flies 10 feet backward. 

Hitha wraps her hair around in a ponytail before attacking even more sikh soldiers. 

Text Underneath: Introducing Srihitha as the Banglore Bear.

Rishika and Negha charge forward with their laptops in each hand. Negha jumps up, does a twirl, and as she comes down brings an enemy down with her. She spins around and slaps another enemy. The enemy hits the ground with a thud. Gurtej starts running towards her with a cricket bat in hand. As the man swings his bat at Negha, Negha grabs the bat and uses it to flip him over sideways. Negha stomps the man till he blacks out. 

Negha
Boba is the secret of my energy.

Rishika throws her laptop at an enemy that is charging towards her, and the enemy falls down to the ground. She kicks some enemies around her and they all fall to the ground. 

Rishika
That’s the power of a Chennai Girl

Sai Aiswarya takes her chemistry textbook and clutches it tightly. A massive, 6 foot 4 inches, 250 pound SSA board member starts charging towards her at full speed. Sai Aiswarya maintains a balanced stance, and brings her chemistry textbook up in attacking formation. 


Sai Aiswarya 
By the time I’m done, you’ll be the one traumatized

Sai Aiswarya swings the textbook across the head of the enemy. As the impact of the book meets the face of the enemy, blood flies out of his mouth. This is the strongest hit the board member has ever taken. The impact of the book flips the board member sideways as he does a full flip midair before he hits the ground. The board member is knocked out cold and does not wake up.

Sai Aiswarya blows a strand of hair across her face. 

Sai Aiswarya
Hmm.. I guess… I Am Traumatizing. 

The battle continues as the SIA alliance continues to battle the SSA army. One by one, the SSA members are taken down. They are no match for the power of SIA. Finally, Agent C is the only one remaining. 

Aswin, Arun, Priya, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Hitha, Rishika, and Aadit all charge forward all at once and use their weapons and skills to attack Agent C all at once. Agent C is no match for this squad and is immediately knocked to the ground. 

Agent C clutches his sides in anguish as he is unable to bear the pain that he is in. It is like he has been attacked by ten thousand bears. 

Agent C looks at Aswin from the ground. Aswin stands over him. 

Agent C
How…how is this possible. I am a genetically enhanced version of you. I’m scientifically proven to be stronger than you, all of you! I had an army of Sikhs. The power of Nidarshan. How did I lose to you weaklings?

Aswin 
You may have all that, but we got something called kampung spirit.

Aswin stomps Agent C

Agent C is dead. 

The members of SIA stand together in a huddle. They are bloodied and bruised all over, but their friendship keeps them standing. The camera captures the sun setting, casting a warm glow over the battle-worn faces of the SIA members, standing united amidst the aftermath of their final fight. Drone footage: starting from the scene of the fight up to an eagle's eye view of the campus. As the camera zooms out over the campus, Aswin voices over.

Aswin(voice over)
We fought harder than we ever thought we could. We faced a darkness that wanted to swallow the world whole, and we came out scarred, but together. Each of us—Arun, Priya, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Hitha, Rishika, Aadit—stood against a force that should have broken us. But we didn’t break. We bled, we struggled... but we never stopped fighting. Today wasn't about revenge or even survival—it was about protecting each other, about honoring the trust that everyday citizens place on Captain C, and proving that no matter how profound our struggles, our friendship will always triumph. We’re bruised, but unbroken. We’re SIA... and no matter what comes next, we’ll face it. Together.

Camera fades from the scene of Purdue campus from an aerial view to Aswin standing outside Triple XXX. 
INT. TRIPLE XXX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Aswin and his friends are gathered around a large table in the bustling Triple XXX Restaurant. Plates of food and drinks cover the table. The group is animated, laughing and joking around.
MEDIUM SHOT: THE WHOLE GROUP
The camaraderie and warmth among them are palpable. Aswin looks around the table, a content smile on his face. Arun, Priya, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Hitha, Rishika, and Aadit are all around him. He then turns to face the camera.
ASWIN 
“Friendship is everything. It’s the family we choose, the people who stand by us no matter what.”
Aswin winks at the camera
The screen begins to darken, with a circle closing in on Aswin's wink.
FADE TO BLACK.

As the SIA guardians are eating at Triple XXX, a man watches them from outside, his face pressed against the window. He glares silently and then turns away while simultaneously pulling his hood over his curly hair. He takes his phone out to make a call as he continues to walk down the hill into the sunset.
