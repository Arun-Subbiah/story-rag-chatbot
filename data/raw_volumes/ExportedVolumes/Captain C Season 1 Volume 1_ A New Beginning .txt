Captain C Season 1 Volume 1: A New Beginning 
By Arun Subbiah

Prologue

The sky was an ominous blend of dark, swirling clouds. For days, the chettiars of the chettinad region had sensed something was amiss. The whisper of the winds was unsettling and the coconut trees spoke with warning. Elders prayed to the local deities, begging for lord Murugan to spare their land from destruction. A great danger was encroaching upon these people. 

A great meteor struck upon the Chettinad region, wiping out the Chettiar caste.The Chettinad region was left in ruins and no one was left to tell the tale. The once thriving Chettinad region, with bustling market streets and populated temples, was now engulfed in chaos and despair. 

However, in the midst of all this destruction, a miracle unfolded. As the police investigated the ruins of the region, they stumbled across a small destroyed hut. Clearing out the ruins of this house, they found a baby. This baby was untouched by flame and debris. He was covered by a Murugan picture frame that had fallen on him, protecting him from the impact. He was the sole survivor of this catastrophe. 

With gentle hands, an elderly police officer lifted up the baby in the air. The sun illuminated the child’s soft features, magnifying the wonder of this miracle. 

“He is the future,” the elderly officer whispered, his voice filled with reverence. “From the ashes of Chettinad and with the power of Murugan, he will rise.”

ASWIN 
“You may be wondering how I ended up here. Well, here's the basic story, starting from that one night that changed my life. In the days leading up to the meteor, I was left at my neighbors house as my parents had both gone to Chennai to get our VISAs done to move to Singapore. I grew up in Singapore and displayed heightened strength from a young age. My time in the military was crucial to my development. I was then sent to college at Purdue University, where I currently study mechanical engineering. I am a staunch devotee of lord Murugan. And yes, I am a superhero.”

Aswin 
“It all began last semester. I was roped into various situations in which I had to save common citizens from criminals in the hoods of Lafayette, where my apartment is. I eventually donned the identity of Captain C, a local superhero in the Purdue area. I am a protector of the campus, a guardian of the everyday people. I made some friends, who are all a part of the South Indian Association. I joined the Operations committee, and these people became my best friends. My circle of friends included Negha, Sai, Aadit, Hitha, Rishika, Sanjana, and Priya. There were more people in the extended SIA group as well, including the treasurer Nidarshan. At first my identity was a secret and nobody knew that I was Captain C- the superhero admired by all of Purdue. Eventually, I told my circle and they began assisting me on my missions. Adit helped me develop my weapons and modify my car(the Chettiarmobile) while the rest of the CS students help provide technological support. SIA helps plan out and execute my tasks. Our secret headquarters is in the basement of the AAARCC, where SIA hosts events.

ASWIN 
I miss my family every day. The burden of being a superhero adds a unique strain. The psychological toll is immense and leaves me feeling isolated . The weight of protecting others can be a heavy cross to bear.
CUT TO: Flashbacks of Aswin struggling alone in his apartment, looking at old family photos, and sitting on his bed, lost in thought.
ASWIN (V.O.) 
But my friends have been my rock, supporting me through it all. When I first shared my secret with them, they embraced me, providing the emotional and practical support I desperately needed.
CUT TO: Shots of Aswin laughing with his friends, working on superhero gear with Adit, and strategizing with the SIA team.
ASWIN (V.O.) 
The best part of being a superhero? The friends who make it all possible. With their help, I've become stronger and more resilient. They've stood by me in my darkest moments, helping me to see that I'm never truly alone. They are not just my friends; they are my family.
