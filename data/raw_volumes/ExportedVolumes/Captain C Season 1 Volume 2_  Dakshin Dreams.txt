Captain C Vol.2: Dakshin Dreams 
	Sunset was minutes away in beautiful West Lafayette. The sky was a calculated swirl of pink and yellow, with peaks of the orange sun seeping through the drifting clouds. Above the Wabash River was the bridge that divided West Lafayette and Lafayette. This bridge was illuminated by the warm, golden light of the setting sun, which casted long, graceful shadows across its length. The gentle rush of the river complemented by the rhythm of ducks quacking created a serene harmony in the air. Aswin stood at the midpoint of the bridge, looking over and admiring the view. This peaceful scene contrasted sharply with the storm that was brewing within Aswin’s complex mind. 
	It was Friday. It was the end of a long week of introductory classes for Aswin in his first week back from break. There was no apparent crime that had taken place since his return- at least not yet. He couldn’t shake the feeling that this was an irregularity, and his mind churned with the fear that a great danger was awaiting the city. 
	The slight breeze rustled his hair and he closed his eyes, letting the gentle rhythms of the river calm his mind. The sun had finally set, and dusk had risen. Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Aswin eagerly fumbled his phone out of his pocket, and saw that it was a text from Negha: “Where are you? We’re already here!”  
A smile spread across Aswin’s handsome face. He had completely forgotten in the midst of sightseeing; he was supposed to meet his friends for dinner at Dakshin! He set off jogging towards the direction of Dakshin, leaving his worries behind on the bridge.

Vol. 2: Dakshin Dreams
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The familiar warmth of Dakshin enveloped Aswin as he walked through the door. The rich aroma of south Indian spices filled the air, making his mouth water with eagerness. He spotted his friends gathered at a table in the back of the small restaurant. Their faces were lit with laughter and happiness. 
ASWIN 
Hey everyone, sorry I’m late
Negha
Grinning
As usual 

Sai Aiswarya
Broooo, he is operating in IST(Indian Standard Time)
The group erupts into laughter
Aadit
So Aswin, what were you doing? Why late?
Aswin
Just admiring the captivating sunset and the small intricate beauties of the modern upstanding world. 
The table goes silent and everyone looks away from Aswin
Suddenly, everyone bursts into laughter and Aswin is embarrassed 
Aswin 
I think I’m just going to go order food now
Aswin gets up, leaving the rowdy table, and walks over to the counter to order. However, nobody is there. 
Aswin looks around but there is no staff around. He hears some arguing in the kitchen beyond the counter. 
Aswin leans back and places his elbow to rest along the counter. He glances at the tv in the corner, where the sun tv channel is playing the movie Enthiran 
Aswin(Voice Over)
Nobody beats Rajini, he is always number one 
As Aswin is admiring Superstar, a mustached man appears behind the counter 
Man 
Sir, can I take your order
Aswin
Yes, one chicken biryani please
Compilation shots of biryani preparation 
Cut to biryani being served at the table and all of the friends happily enjoying the food
Hitha
Priya, have you tried this before 
Priya 
No, this is actually my first time!
Rishika 
Guys, what is the next SIA event?
Negha 
So the plan is to have callouts next week in the WALC basement and then after that we will start dance practice for our mock kalyanam event. I’ll put the message in the old group me soon 
Sanjana
Oh I’m not going to dance
Sai Aiswarya
C’mon Sanjana you have to!!!
Negha
No you are the president, please!
Sai Aiswarya
If you don’t dance, I will be traumatized 
Cut to the group leaving Dakshin and walking back up the hill to their dorms
Hitha
Awesome food but did you know there is going to be a Hyderabad House opening here soon? 
The group clamors in excitement
Aswin 
No Dakshin will always be better
Cut to the group talking and continuing to walk up the hill  
Suddenly, group of three drunk college students come up behind and begin to harass the group 
Harasser 1
Look at these Indian freaks 
Harasser 2
Go back to where you came from 
Aswin 
Back off
Harasser 3
Or what?
Aswin fiercely stares into the harasser’s eyes with boiling anger
Harassers get uncomfortable and cross to the other side of the road
Aswin 
C’mon guys, let’s keep going 
Sai Aiswarya
Wow, that was traumatizing 
Aadit 
If only they knew you were Captain C
Negha
They would’ve ran away instantly 
Harasser 2 looks behind his back and meets Aswin’s eyes. They lock eyes for 5 seconds before Harasser 2 spits on the ground and leaves with the rest of his group 
Cut to the squad arriving in the Windsor lobby. Aadit, Rishika, and Hitha continue to Hillenbrand. Aswin’s car is parked in the Windsor parking lot. He drives back to his apartment. 
 Playful friendship music is played in the background as the remaining friends walk up the stairs to the third floor. They reach the intersection point between Sai and Sanjana’s dorm and Negha and Priya’s dorm. 
Sanjana and Sai are at standing in front of their door while Priya and Negha are across in front of their room
Sanjana
What an awesome day..
Priya
Only more of these to come. I can’t wait for all the adventures we’re all going to have this semester
Sai Aiswarya
Yesssss
Sanjana
I love you guys and I am so grateful that I get to call you my friends 
Negha 
Awwww.. well good night guys
The group hugs and exchanges good nights before heading back to their respective rooms 
All one single shot: The camera follows Sai Aiswarya and Sanjana into their room. The camera first follows Sai Aiswarya’s side of the room and circularly loops around to Sanjana’s side. The messy nature of the room is emphasized by this shot, especially the mountain of items on the chairs. The shot ends with focus on an alarm clock reading the time: 10:55 am. The creative emphasis is to get a lived in or interactive feeling of the room and to form a closer connection with the characters Sanjana and Sai Aiswarya.
Sanjana 
Oh no! I forgot to get gummy bears at third st market. I’m going to make a quick trip, Sai. Sai?
Sanjana turns around and sees Sai asleep 
Sanjana smiles and leaves the room. The camera follows her out and fades dark. The screen is dark for 5 seconds before suddenly coming back and a focus on the alarm clock is shown. The clock reads 2:07 am. 
Sai Aiswarya suddenly wakes up and is startled. She hops up to her feet. 
Sai Aiswarya
Sanj?
Time lapse shot of Sai Aiswarya doing Shell project and continuously looking back at the clock. 
Finally the clock hits 2:30 am 
Sai Aiswarya calls Sanjana but no answer. She calls a few more times before walking over to Priya and Negha’s room and knocking. 
Negha opens
Negha 
Sai, what’s wrong?
Sai Aiswarya
Stammering
It’s Sanjana, I don’t know where she went! She isn’t picking up, this is so unlike her!
Priya 
Sai, it’s okay. Did you check her location? 
Sai Aiswarya
No! 
Sai Aiswarya, trembling, fumbles her phone out of her pocket and quickly hits the find my app 
Sai Aiswarya 
Look! It says she’s just out in the Windsor parking lot!
The trio sprint down the hallway, past Jiapei’s room, past the whiteboard, down the stairs, and out the front entrance. 
The trio track the phone’s exact location
Priya 
She should be over there!
All in a single shot: The trio scrambles over and the camera is positioned behind them, following their desperate stride. They stop dead in their tracks. The camera slowly moves forward, past the trio, and moves towards the ground, where a bright pink phone is on the ground. The camera moves close up to the phone and the phone is revealed to be heavily cracked.

Starts to tear up

Priya 
With fear in her eyes
Gone?..

Sai Aiswarya
Now I am actually traumatized 
Camera turns black
