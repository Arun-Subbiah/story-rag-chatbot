Captain C Season 1 Volume 3
Captain C 
Volume 3:
Saving Sanjana

Aswin lay front side up on his bed, with the gentle hum of his ceiling fan singing him a lullaby as he drifted into sleep. The room was covered in darkness with only an alarm clock providing a gentle glow.

Stage 1: Light Sleep 
Aswin’s breathing slowed and his body relaxed. His mind slowly edged away from his worries about the city, and drifted into the first stage of sleep.

Stage 2: Onset of Sleep
Aswin’s body temperature dropped slightly and his heartbeat steadied into a predictive rhythm. His twisted consciousness slipped further and further away, leaving him in a peaceful state of rest.

Stage 3: Deep Sleep
The world outside became a distant memory for Aswin as he entered deep sleep. Aswin was oblivious to the real world, where the stress of the everyday terrorized him. His body and mind were rejuvenating. He was recovering from a long week of balancing between being Captain C and being Aswin.

Stage 4: REM Sleep 
R.E.M. Rapid eye movement. Aswin’s eyes darted back and forth beneath his closed eyelids, like a tennis ball in the midst of an intense tennis match. A vivid dream filled his mind and transported him to a different world.

First, Aswin was on a field of dandelions.  Aswin joyfully frolicked across the field, without a worry in the world. As he ran, brown feathered birds flew with him, as if they were challenging him to a race! A dark shadow of a woman could be seen from a distance. She was performing bharatanatyam. Aswin started running towards her.

Suddenly, the ground began trembling. A giant crater opened up under Aswin’s feet. He began to fall through, into a void of perpetual darkness. Aswin yelled, “No! I don’t want to go!”

Aswin landed with a loud thud. He looked around, analyzing his environment. Aswin was back on the bridge overlooking the Wabash River from earlier that day. However, something was off; this wasn’t the same place. Although it was seemingly daytime, the sky was dark and murky. The bridge was enveloped in dark vines and seemed extremely filthy. The smell of death infected the air. This place was dystopian. Aswin panicked. This bridge was his happy place. It was the spot he would go to clear his mind. Seeing it in this state of disarray shattered his heart. He tried running away, but every time he reached the end of the bridge, he was magically transported back to the center of the bridge. Aswin was trapped in a cycle! His breathing picked up. Again, and again, and again, he couldn’t escape. Aswin shrieked,” LET ME GO, PLEA-“

The shrill of his phone ringing pierced the silence of the room, awaking Aswin from his nightmare. His eyes flew open, and he was disoriented with his heart pounding. Aswin was drenched in sweat. He fumbled for his phone on his nightstand, blinking against the harsh glare of the screen. The call was from Negha.

Aswin
Voice groggy 
Negha, it’s 2:45 am!

Negha
Aswin, it’s Sanjana. You need to come quick. She’s gone

Aswin’s Eyes fill with terror 

Aswin 
Okay, I’ll be there right away 

Negha
Aswin… I’m scared 

Aswin
It’s fine, I’m coming. We’ll sort this out. Call the police too. But… should I come as Aswin or… or.. as Captain C?

Negha
Just Aswin, for now at least… Bring the suit just in case.

Aswin puts down his phone and zips open his backpack. The camera is behind Aswin as he opens his cupboard, goes to the end of his shirts that are hung up, and stares for a moment. Camera cuts to reveal the Captain C costume to the audience for the first time. Inspiring superhero music interludes into the Captain C theme music 

Captain C title sequence plays with Captain C theme music

Vol 3: Saving Sanjana

Aswin arrives at the Windsor door, the door across from Starbucks/Krach. Just as he arrives a Police vehicle leaves.

Aswin gets out his phone and texts Negha: “I’m here” 

Aswin leans across the railing staring at the ground with intensity 

*Moments later Negha opens the door, rushes to Aswin, and hugs him 

Negha
Crying 
Aswin! They found blood! Oh this is terrible! 

Aswin
I’m here, I’m here! It’s going to be alright. Trust me 

*Negha looks up and meets Aswin eyes

Cut to Sanjana and Sai Aiswarya’s room. 360 degree shot of Aswin analyzing the room in a circle, revealing Sai Aiswarya, Priya, and Negha to be surrounding Aswin 

Priya 
The police just took Sai’s statement and didn’t say anything else. They didn’t even seem to care about Sanjana! No further questions or anything!

Negha
I’m telling you, if the West Lafayette Police Department was more competent, Captain C wouldn’t even be needed!

Aswin 
And Sai, you’re saying you never saw her leave

Sai Aiswarya 
I randomly woke up and she was just gone!

Aswin 
Interesting…

Aswin inspects Sanjana’s desk and his eyes slowly drive over to the trash can near the door 

Aswin ducks under Aadit’s poster and looks down at the trash can 

Aswin 
Sai, what is Sanjana’s favorite snack?

Sai Aiswarya
Well, she does love gummy bears. She always has them with her. 

Aswin glances even closer. Camera slowly leans into trash can, revealing empty wrapper of gummy bears 

Aswin
You know, you can learn more about a person looking through their trash rather than looking at their belongings. 

Priya and Negha and Sai glance at each other

Aswin 
What must have happened is she went to buy gummy bears at third st market after she ran out 

Aswin pauses

C‘Mon, let’s go to the parking lot 

Cut to one by one, the group exits the Windsor front door and walks over to the parking lot

Aswin 
Sai go stand at the exact spot where you found her phone 

Sai Aiswarya walks up to the spot 

Aswin follows her and tells her to move aside. Aswin then stands at the spot 

Sai Aiswarya 
The police took her phone for evidence 

Aswin kneels down at the spot. 

Aswin closes his eyes and tries to visualize what could have happened. 

Aswin 
And the blood?

Negha 
The police took a sample and cleaned it up. It was found in that area over there

Negha points 3ft away from where Aswin is standing 

Aswin
Could be either the attackers blood

Pauses

Or Sanjana’s. 

Priya
Aswin, there’s two big pieces that the police kinda ignored. First, look over there, there’s a bunch of broken glass. 

Aswin walks over a few more feet and hovers over the broken glass

Aswin 
Interesting, and the police never considered this as evidence?

Negha
No, but they wrote it down. However, they said it could be coincidental. To quote them: “glass breaks all the time”

Priya leans down, putting her knee on the ground, and inspects the glass. She begins to touch the glass

Negha
Priya, careful!

Priya rearranges the broken pieces of glass, like a puzzle, and constructs a test tube

Aswin
A test tube, interesting.

Pauses 

 Let me think, who could’ve done this to Sanjana? She doesn’t seem to have any enemies 

Sai Aiswarya 
I suspect those guys who harassed us up the hill after Dakshin, they were quite traumatizing 

Negha
I agree, they gave me the jeepers!

Aswin 
I thought the same. They could’ve followed us after we confronted them. Priya, what else did the police ignore?

Priya
Over at the edge of the curb, a bunch of spilled rice was found. Uncooked..

The group runs forwards about ten feet to the edge of the curb. A few handfuls of rice were scattered around in clumps, as if it had fallen from something. 

Negha 
Basmati rice..

Priya 
The police said this rice was irrelevant. They hypothesized a student who cooks in the Windsor kitchen probably dropped it on her way from the car to the kitchen. 

Aswin
That could be a valid reason actually 

Sai Aiswarya
But the parking lot is a decent distance from this exact location. This curb is kind of isolated, don’t you think?

Aswin 
Sai! Excellent observation. The placement of this rice does seem to be a bit dodgy. 

The group sits down along the curb, all staring at the clump of rice

Aswin 
Let’s try to revisit our series of events. I met you guys at Dakshin, I was late, you guys were all at the table, food was served, we ate biryani-

Negha 
That’s it: they use basmati rice for the Dakshin chicken biryani! The one Aswin got!

Aswin
That is quite random though. How in the world could the biryani at Dakshin possibly relate to this spilled rice all the way over here 

Negha
I don’t know.. 

Aswin stands up. Close up on Aswin’s determined face

Aswin 
This seems improbable to actually be connected to Sanjana. But… I guess it’s our only lead. From Dakshin we begin our investigation. 

Negha
This is too much for me, I’m so scared! I need a boba break!

Negha, crying, starts walking down 3rd st to Tsaocaa

Zoom in on Negha’s face as she walks. Shaky camera. Tears are flowing all down her face. Creative emphasis is to show her disheveled, broken state. 

Aswin(calling after her)
Negha, it’s almost 4am! Tsacoaa doesn’t open for another 8 hours!
