Captain C
Volume 4 
Secrets Of West Lafayette 

By the time Dakshin opened the following morning, 8 more Purdue students had been kidnapped. Students were terrified and consumed with the fear that they would be next. Purdue university began receiving national attention and large numbers of cops were dispatched to patrol the campus. 

Captain C title sequence plays with Captain C theme music

Aswin is driving into the Dakshin parking lot. The time in his car reads 11:58am. He parks and enters Dakshin. He walks up to the counter. A man with a mustache emerges from the kitchen and meets Aswin at the cash register.

Aswin(Thinking: Voice Over) 
This guy is familiar. He took my order last night. He was the one who was arguing with another guy in the kitchen before coming out late to take my order. 

Man 
Welcome sir what would you like to have?

Aswin 
Hi, I would like one masala dosa please

Man 
Sorry sir, no dosa today 

Aswin 
Ok, then chicken biryani 

Man 
Sorry sir, we’ve ran out of rice 

Aswin 
Then, poori?

Aswin pays and gets his receipt 

Aswin 
I was just wondering, who is the owner of Dakshin?

Man
You’re speaking to him right now! I’m Mr. Naraynan 

Aswin 
Oh wow! Nothing much, I just wanted to thank you for all the quality food I have here. Dakshin truly is a blessing 

Mr. Naraynan
Of course! We’re happy to have customers like you. Wait a moment.. 

Mr. Naraynan walks over to the fridge and takes out a Mango Lassi 

Mr Naraynan 
This one’s on us, enjoy! 

Aswin 
Wow! Thank you sir

Mr. Naraynan smiles and walks back to the kitchen 

Aswin walks to the middle table and sits  there

Aswin(Thinking)
What a great man…

Aswin taps his hands on the table creating a beat. He glances at the tv in the corner where the movie Padyappa is playing 

Aswin 
Hmmm.. Maybe I should look around. 

Aswin investigates the empty restaurant to no avail 

Aswin 
This just looks like the same old Dakshin…

Aswin’s eyes wander around and stop at the kitchen. Aswin closes his eyes and the screen is black. Suddenly cut to Aswin stealthily but quickly jumping over the counter and entering the kitchen. 

Aswin hides behind the first wall in front of the main kitchen area. The kitchen is empty except for Mr. Naraynan cooking at the stove. 

Aswin 
No chef. Interesting… But there was a chef the other day… that chef was the one who was arguing with Naraynan 

Aswin sees Mr. Naraynan walk over to the corner of the kitchen. He looks behind his back twice before kneeling down and opening a trap door attached to the ground. He enters inside and uses a ladder to get down. 

Aswin’s eyebrows raise 

Aswin 
Negha was right, there is something suspicious 

Aswin kneels and creeps along the island countertop that is in the center of the kitchen. Aswin gets to the trapdoor and pauses 

Mr. Naraynan gets to the bottom of the ladder and walks through a door and then closes it

Aswin quietly climbs down and puts his ear against the door 

Mr. Naraynan 
Suresh, excellent job. We now have our ten. The boss will be here tonight to pick them all up. Any problems with the job?

Suresh 
No sir, all of them were smooth. Except the first girl with the curly hair, the one who came in last night. She put up quite a fight. If it weren’t for the new tranquilizer, I’m not sure I could’ve taken her. Why was the boss so intent on kidnapping her? 

Mr. Naraynan 
I’m not sure, but she was his number one target. The rest we kidnapped, he didn’t care about. But for this girl, he even gave us her picture to keep in case she ever walked in the restaurant. 

Suresh
Sir there were some issues with kidnapping her

Mr. Naraynan 
Issues? What do you mean!




Suresh
As I was spraying her with the tranquilizer gun, she kicked the test tube attached to the tranquilizer. Even though the weapon still was sprayed and was enough to sedate her, the test tube fell and shattered. 

Mr. Naraynan 
Hmmm.. I’m not sure that is enough to lead back to us. 

The sound of disassembling is heard. (Suresh disassembling the weapon)

Suresh 
Look, on the test tube, the letter ‘J’ is inscribed. Who is that?

Mr. Naraynan 
That’s the partner of my boss. He is the one who is making all the tranquilizers. 

Suresh
And one more thing. I brought our supply van to kidnap her, the one where we have all our groceries. In the rush, I forgot to close the van door. After I was able to tranquilize her, I quickly sped out of the parking lot and ran over a curb. Some rice bags that were cut in the fight spilled out as I ran over the curb. 

Mr. Naraynan 
I was wondering where all the rice went. It’s fine, no way they’ll trace that rice back to us. That rice brand is used by hundreds of students. Speaking of students, the handsome boy upstairs is waiting on his poori. I’ll be back. 

Aswin eyes expand in alarm 

Aswin 
Oh No!

Aswin quickly fumbles in his pocket and pulls out his emergency Captain C mask. Aswin quickly kicks the door open and stares Mr. Naraynan face to face. 

Mr. Naraynan 
Stammering 
Captain…Cap…Captain C?

Aswin 
That’s my name

Aswin charges forward and kicks Mr. Naraynan. Mr. Naraynan flies back ten feet and hits the wall with a loud bang. Mr Naraynan groans in pain. 

Cut to Sanjana in the corner awaking from the loud sound as her eyes quickly dart open

Aswin analyzes the room around him. Groceries are scattered around the room. In one corner of the room: Nine students, a mix of boys and girls, have their hands tied with a rope and are in a state of sleep. One of the hostages is the chef. Sanjana, the tenth, has just woken up. In another corner: a sack filled with a weird type of gun with a test tube attached to the bottom of the gun. Large knives are also within the sack. 

Suresh turns and makes a grimacing face at Aswin

Suresh runs at Captain C with a knife in his hand pointing out 

Captain C grabs Suresh by the hand, and flips him completely over, slamming him down against the ground and the knife falls a few feet away in the commotion. 

Suresh yells in pain 

From behind Mr. Naraynan has a tranquilizer pointed right at Aswin’s back

Mr. Naraynan 
One step and you’ll be sedated for the next 5 hours


Cut to Aswin’s alarmed eyes

Aswin
Oh no! I’m trapped! Am I done for?

Suddenly Sanjana does a flip and in the process of doing the flip (while still in the air), breaks the rope tied to her hands with a strong diverging motion 

Sanjana then runs forward, jumps 5ft, and then kicks Mr. Naraynan. The gun falls and the testube attached to the gun shatters.
The liquid inside makes a hissing sound as it leaks out of the broken glass.

Mr. Naraynan, screaming out of pain, flies back 10ft and hits Suresh on the ground. 

Suddenly Suresh and Mr. Naraynan glance at each other and then get up off the ground and stand up. They both stare with rage at Aswin and Sanjana.

Shot of both Aswin and Sanjana engaging in a fighting stance with both their fists in front of them and their feet squared. They are ready for a fight. Exciting theme music accompanies this new fighting duo. 

Wide angle shot of Suresh and Mr. Naraynan running from the left and Aswin and Sanjana running from the right. In slow motion.

Intense fight with Sanjana jumping in the air, kicking Mr. Naraynan’s chest, using that force to do a flip, and then delivering a punch on the way down, knocking Mr. Naraynan out. Camera pans to Sanjana’s fist. Creative emphasis is to show the rise and future potential of a new hero in West Lafayette.

Meanwhile, as Suresh is about to use his knife on Aswin, Aswin dodges by jumping over Suresh, does a backflip, and delivers a flying kick on the way down as Suresh flies back 10 ft and hits the back end of the room. Suresh is knocked out. 

Text on Screen: The Next Day 

Aswin, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, and Priya all are sitting in front of a TV in the PMU. The tv is playing the news.

News Lady 
A fabulous rescue by Captain C in the Dakshin hidden basement, saving 10 hostages who were kidnapped over the course of one night. Arrested were owner Naraynan and his worker Suresh. Their motives are unknown and they are refusing to speak to the police. Among the hostages was Dakshin chef Durai Singam, who is currently speaking to the police and is giving as much information as possible for the police to investigate the motives behind this string of kidnappings. 

Camera pans over from screen to Aswin’s intense eyes

Sai Aiswarya
Wow, what a few days huh. I’m so glad it’s over now.

Aswin 
But it’s not. There are so many questions that are left to be answered. This is just a beginning.

Aswin looks down and puts his head in his hands

Aswin 
After we tied up Mr. Naraynan and Suresh, I was able to talk to the chef, Mr. Singam. What I heard was terrifying 

Cut to Flashback 

Chef Singam 
Naraynan was just a hire for the job. The main threat is beyond Naraynan. It’s Naraynan’s boss. Their boss is the head of organized crime in West Lafayette. But his identity remains a mystery, lurking in the shadows. 

Aswin 
What’s their plan?

Chef Singam
They’re building something big, something that has the potential to take so many lives, some master weapon. I don’t know what it is, but it’s big.

Aswin 
How do you know?

Chef Singam
I found out about Naraynan’s plans in the evening two days ago, about his plans to kidnap that girl who had just walked in with a group. For some reason, they wanted to eliminate that girl more than anything. I overheard him talking about it with Suresh. And once I confronted him, he ended up sedating me and I became one of the kidnapped!

Aswin 
Do you know why they had to kidnap all these people? What were their plans? 

Chef Singam 
I think for slave labor. Their boss’s partner, the one who made the sedation gun, had engineered some other hypnotizing drug. They were planning to use that drug on these ten people and use them as labor to complete whatever project the boss’s working on. 

Aswin 
Thank you for your help sir

Cut to present day 

Aswin 
Sanjana, do you remember anything over the course of that night? Anybody else that came in that night? Who is this guy?

Sanjana
I don’t know, my memory is very episodic because of the sedation. However, I have some vague memories of one person walking in. 

Aswin 
Who! What did he look like?

Sanjana 
I don’t know! I’m trying to remember, but it’s so blurry! He may have been wearing a suit, wait no he was wearing a leather jacket. No wait, Suresh was the one wearing a leather jacket. Wait, he was short. No, I think he was tall. But someone there was medium height? But there was someone with dark colored clothing, or maybe glasses, or maybe a large jacket. I just don’t know! The guy who walked in, it was definitely their boss! But just at that exact moment they sedated me again. The next time I woke up was 5 hours later, when you came.

Aswin 
Interesting. That is who we are after. The leader of organized crime in West Lafayette, and we have to catch him before he launches his ultimate weapon, whatever that may be. He has an entire empire. And why did he want Sanjana? What does he have against Sanjana? But our first step will have to be to go after this leader’s partner, that mysterious ‘J’ who’s making these tranquilizer/sedation guns. He must be using his skills with making these bio weapons to assist the leader in whatever weapon he’s creating. 

Negha
Looks like we’re going to have an eventful semester 

Aswin 
You’re damn right it’s going to be eventful. I’m going to find this guy no matter what.

Negha
I was talking about eventful as in SIA events.. The callout is in a few days!
