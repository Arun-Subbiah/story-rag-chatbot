Captain C
Volume 6
Rise of The Chettiar

Setting: A dark room with a single desk across the far wall, a small lamp illuminating the desk. A man is writing a blueprint of some unknown project for some unknown machine. The camera is positioned behind the man so his face or identity isn’t shown and he remains a mystery to the audience. Camera moves forward to reveal the blueprint in front of him. The blueprint is titled: Project C.

A laptop is also on the desk. On the laptop, the display reads: Project C: 45% complete

Suddenly the ringing of a phone is heard. The man brings his phone out of his pocket and looks down. The phone displays: Call from ‘J’

Sudden Cut and Transition to 

Captain C title sequence plays with Captain C theme music

Shot of the AAARCC from the outside. Date: February 3rd

Camera tracks from the front door, to around the corner before the kitchen, down the stairs and through a door.

In the basement of the AAARCC, Captain C and his friends are huddled around a table. Bottom text: Captain C secret lair, headquarters of Captain C operations

Aswin
Priya, are you serious? Is this ‘J’ really a Purdue student? 

Priya
It’s true. 

Priya stares forward at the box filled with test tubes

Aswin takes out a test tube and examines it. A close up shot of the test tube reveals the letter ‘J’.

Aswin 
And he’s just one of us. A student, causally wandering about the Corec. It’s… it’s just…

Sanjana
Crazy

Negha
Unreal

Sai Aiswarya 
Traumatizing 

Aswin folds his arms and slouches back

Aswin
Even the Dakshin bust wasn’t enough to stop these guys from executing their master plan of creating that mystery weapon. We have to catch these guys… whatever it takes. 

Sanjana
I’m in 

Priya 
Me too 

Aswin puts his hand in the middle 

The rest of the gang follows

Negha
SIA on three 

Rishika 
One… Two… Three 

The entire gang yells “SIA” and put their hands up collectively 

Negha
Guys it’s getting late by the way, we still have to set up for the Member Game afternoon at 2, followed by the Dosa club feature and Kannada language workshop.

Sai Aiswarya
And our first dance practice tonight!!!

Hitha 
I can’t wait!!

Cut to the Main floor of AAARCC. SIA board members are helping to set up the event.

Aadit
It’s almost 2, members should be here by now

Aswin 
Aren’t there only like 5 members?

Suddenly the door opens 
Aswin and his friends quickly look at the door, excitement building as to whom this may be.

A tall Indian boy with glasses emerges from the door. He is wearing all black. The door slams with a loud thud. He looks over at Aswin and the gang and smiles. 

Aswin 
Nidarshan! Great to see you ma boy!

Aadit
Hey Nidarshan, how’s it going 

Nidarshan 
Oh it’s going well, you know the usual. I have so much work. 

Hitha
A lot of work in 381?

Nidarshan 
Yes still a lot of papers to grade

Sai Aiswarya
Noooo

Nidarshan 
Bowing 
But I’m glad to be back and spend time with my favorite people 

Aswin 
That’s awesome

Everyone collectively 
We love you Nidarshan 

Nidarshan looks at them with gratitude and smiles 

Time Lapse shot of all the SIA board members setting up the Floor with games and some snacks such as mixture in the back

Cut to shot of three boys talking in the tv room. 


Sahil 
Hi I’m Sahil 

Anurag 
Hi I’m Anurag 

Anurag and Sahil turn to the left 

Anurag 
What’s your name bro?

Jason 
Hey, I’m Jason 

Sahil 
Are you Indian?

Jason 
Yeah my dad is Tamil. I’m from Bloomington 

Suddenly the door flies open. Sahil, Anurag, and Jason turn back and look at the door. 

Negha and Sai Aiswarya look at the door from the kitchen and their eyes display alarm.

Two boys enter through. Both have curly hair and are incredibly handsome and muscular. 

Negha
It’s the guys from the callout 

Sai Aiswarya
I have a bad feeling about this

The two boys walk to the main room

Boy 1
Look, it’s the guy in the suit!

Boy 2
Oh yeah, it is! Let’s go troll him 

They two boys walk up to Nidarshan 

Boy 2
Hi brah 

Nidarshan 
What are you two doing here?

Boy 1
We’re here for you 

Boy 1 turns to the right. 

Boy 1 
Jason Thiagarajan!

Jason 
Hey guys.. what’s up 

Camera slowly pans over to Aswin in the corner observing the situation 

Cut to Boy 1, Boy 2, Jason, and Sahil playing Carom Board

Sahil 
So what are your names 

Boy 2
I’m Gotham, Gotham Ramesh

Jason 
Nah, his name is Rohit. And his name is Arun 

Arun
Bruh 

Jason
This game is so fun. I played a bit in India this last summer. It’s cool they brought it to this member social. Wait, are you guys even members?

Arun and Rohit ignore and continue playing carrom board

The boys continue playing the game of carrom board while the camera slowly moves backwards and reveals Aswin observing the boys.

Negha walks by 


Negha 
Aswin… What's up? What are you doing?

Aswin 
There’s something about that boy…

Negha
What is it?

Aswin 
I don’t know, I can’t describe it… there’s some force that exists between us. I’ve never felt this connection before

Negha
A force?

Aswin 
I feel it, in my heart. There’s a connection, down to the very core of who I am. In my blood, there’s something that binds me to him

Aswin abruptly walks towards the boys playing carrom board while Negha is left behind with a confused expression 

Aswin walks to the table and meets Arun at the table. Arun looks up at him 

Aswin locks eye contact with Arun. 

Arun smiles, but his smile quickly disappears. 

Arun's heart jolts and he feels the same force that Aswin had felt before. A connection rooted down deep in his blood. A connection that triggers the questions of who he truly is and the mysteries surrounding his past. Arun felt these multidimensional, layered, and complex emotions all in the matter of these last 5 seconds. 

Spinning shot where the camera does circles around the two boys for a 20sec, emphasizing the tension and connection felt by the two boys (Like in Petta Climax)

Suddenly the camera rotations stop and cuts to a close up of Aswin 

Aswin 
Are you affiliated with the chettiar region?
