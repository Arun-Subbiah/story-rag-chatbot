Recap of Part 1: It is the day of the SIA member social. The SIA board welcomes visitors to the AAARCC, including a boy named Arun. Aswin observes Arun from a distance, feeling an unexplainable force drawing him closer. Intrigued and unsettled, Aswin approaches Arun, their eyes meeting in a moment of intense, silent recognition. Both are struck by a powerful connection, something primal and profound, as if their destinies are intertwined.

I…I…I am….

Aswin
Incredible…How is this possible..

Arun 
How.. How did you know?

Aswin 
I just felt this, unreal, indescribable, ethereal…. Connection…

Arun
I felt it as well, but I still don’t understand… How do you know about the Chettiar region?

Aswin takes a deep breath, his gaze unwavering. The tension between them becomes palpable.

Aswin
I thought I was the last surviving chettiar. I didn’t know any of us survived

Arun
A few Chettiar families escaped the great Chettiar disaster of 2001. My parents were in Chennai at the time, and they only heard about the disaster on the news. Wait.. are you the baby that miraculously survived the disaster 

Aswin
Yes, that’s me 

The boys and Negha watch the interaction with intrigue, unable to process the improbability and miracle of the situation 

Aswin 
We have to go down to the basement. Negha, alert the group 

Negha
On it, chief.

Negha pulls out her phone and texts the group: Emergency meeting

What’s up, who is this kid

This boy, he is a chettiar

It can’t be!

Priya 
No way!

Aswin 
His family escaped the Chettinad tragedy of 2001.  And he says he may not be the only one

Negha
Marvelous 

Aswin 
Me and Arun have discussed, and he has agreed to be trained by me. I have already told him that I am Captain C. He will take on the role of my sidekick. Arun could end up being a crucial factor in defeating the current danger that’s facing West Lafayette.

Sai Aiswarya
This is traumatizing

Negha 
Arun, have you noticed any powers, anything strange. Like super strength?

Arun 
In flashes… suddenly I become super strong and super fast, but it suddenly slips away. I don’t know, I thought I was just tripping out 

Aswin 
And that is exactly why he needs to be trained…

Negha
Trained in dance! Arun you should join the SIA dance practice tonight for our mock Kalyanam event

Arun 
Sure sounds like fun, I’ll bring my friend

Aswin Rolls his eyes

Aswin 
We need to start training, the city is in danger!

Arun 
You should dance too

How do you do this part again 

Jason 
You have to move your hands up and down while turning around 

Jason demonstrates 

Aswin 
Ohhh.. I think I got it 

Negha 
Looking pretty good everyone, I think we’re going to call it a day for today 

Negha turns back to Sai

Negha
Sai, where is Priya, she said she would be here soon?

Sai 
Priya got delayed at her Ninja class. She called and said she’s on the way

Oh ok

Nah, I got a small meeting. I’ll join in next time

Priya
Hey everyone

Negha and Sai 
Priya!! You’re just in time

It’s Mango Mango time!

Priya 
Let’s go!

Aswin turns his head and looks in the corner

Aswin 
Hey, whose backpack is that?

Arun also looks 

(Camera tracks Arun and Aswin turning and looking, but does not reveal the corner of the room)

Arun 
I think Jason’s, he must have accidentally left it back 

Priya turns casually and looks at the corner of the room. Camera tracks Priya’s face as she turns her head. Her eyes lock and then suddenly widen and display fear/alarm. Haunting background music plays. Camera zooms out from Priya’s face and finally reveals the corner of the room, which contains a red backpack.
