Aswin 
It was Jason all along 

Arun
That ‘J’ you were talking about?

Priya 
It has to be, it’s that exact same backpack. I remember it clearly. And look, there’s even that small tear on the side 

Camera focuses on the backpack with haunting music 

Aswin 
Well, there’s only one way to make sure it’s him 

Arun 
Let’s open it. Let’s check if those vials you mentioned are there

Negha 
But that’s an invasion of his privacy!

Aswin walks past Negha and walks over to the bag. He reaches down and starts to zip open the bag. Camera goes to his POV of opening the bag with the camera pointing at the bag 

As the bag is being opened, cut to… 

Captain C Title Sequence with Captain C theme song 

Cut to bag being opened

Aswin 
(Opens the backpack, staring into it with growing confusion)
It's... empty…

Priya
(Leaning in, her brow furrowing)
Empty? That can’t be right. The vials... they should be there

Cut to the empty backpack, with nothing but a few snacks and some homework inside 

Aswin 
Wait.. where did Jason say he was going?

Arun 
He said he had a small meeting.. He is probably not far from here. If we run we can catch him!

Arun and Aswin run out the door and zoom through Stuart. They race up the stairs past a clock that reads 8:30pm. The camera focuses on the clock. They dash out the Stuart door across the PMU. Arun and Aswin stop in their tracks. They look up and see Jason walking across in front of the PMU 

Aswin 
There he is!

Arun and Aswin follow Jason but maintain a safe distance

Suddenly, Jason stops. He gets a call, speaks for 20 seconds. Then he texts for about 30 seconds. Then he puts the phone back in his pocket. He then continues to walk down the street. 

Aswin 
Could that be his boss? The mastermind we are after?

Arun 
Or what if that’s just his friend, asking him where he is to hangout?

Aswin 
We’ll see where he goes. 

Arun and Aswin continue to follow him all the way down the street as he enters the boba shop. Jason waves to a few boys in the back of the store and sits with them.

Arun 
Huh.. Maybe it is just a coincidence. Two backpacks that look the same but belong to different people 

Aswin 
Could be.. Priya did say that Jason’s backpack matched up perfectly with the one she saw in the Corec.. Down to the finest details.. 

Arun 
But thinking about it, it makes perfect sense. Jason is a biological engineer, it would make sense that he is the mastermind behind those bioweapons that can put you to sleep 

Aswin 
True.. but we don’t know for sure.. But let's keep our eye on him.. 

Fade to text: “The next night”
At Windsor Dining court, Priya, Sai, and Negha are sitting at a table. They are all eating Confetti cake. 

Priya
Hey, where’s Aswin?

Sai 
Yeah, I haven’t seen him since yesterday

Negha 
Him and Arun are going to investigate the Purdue Research Lab.. They say that’s where the bioweapons might be manufactured. 

Priya 
That’s pretty risky.. If they get caught, they could be severely punished, even expelled!

Sai 
This is traumatizing 

Cut to Arun and Aswin on the roof of the Purdue Research Lab. They lower a rope down the chimney and enter the attic. They then move a tile and swiftly jump down into a classroom on the top floor of the building. The classroom is dark, as well as the entirety of the building. 

Aswin pulls out a folded piece of paper out of his pocket and lays it out on a table. Arun aims a flashlight at the paper. 

Aswin 
Here’s the blueprint of the building.. Look here: on the fourth floor there’s a manufacturing area 

Arun and Aswin walk down the stairs and reach the fourth floor. Aswin takes a deep breath in and looks at Arun. 

Aswin 
You ready?

Arun 
I’m scared, but.. I have you 

Aswin nods
Aswin reaches for the doorknob, his hand trembling slightly as he’s about to turn it. Just as he is about to open the door, the door suddenly swings open with force, slamming into Aswin’s face. He stumbles back, clutching his face in pain. Groaning, he slowly lifts his head.
Cut to: Arun’s wide-eyed, stunned expression, frozen in place.
Aswin, still dazed, shifts his gaze from Arun toward the figure standing in the doorway. The camera follows Aswin’s POV as it pans from Arun’s shocked face to the mysterious figure who opened the door. 
Reveal: It’s Jason.
Jason 
Excuse me, guys

Arun and Aswin are frozen. Jason shakes his head, and moves past them and starts down the stairs. 

Arun 
Jason!

Jason turns back slowly and stares at Arun 

Jason 
How do you know my name?

Arun and Aswin have blank and confused expressions. 

Aswin 
Did you forget us that quickly, we just hung out last night! At the dance practice?

Jason stares blankly

Arun 
I’ve known you since last semester!

Jason shakes his head and continues to walk down the stairs. As he disappears from sight, the camera moves from the dark back to Arun and Aswin’s blank and confused expressions. 

Arun and Aswin turn and stare at each other

Aswin 
What is going on?


Arun 
I don’t know, that is Jason right?

Aswin 
Yeah, I mean, he did turn back when we called out ‘Jason’

Arun 
What if he’s just pranking us

Aswin 
Could be. Another thing: his beard grows really fast 

Arun 
Yeah I noticed as well. Yesterday it was way shorter. 

Aswin 
Anyways.. That was odd. 

Arun 
Let’s just continue 

Arun and Aswin continue in the lab and observe around them. There are all kinds of technological equipment and manufacturing tools. At the very end of the room there is a massive cupboard with a sign reading: ‘Research Files’

Arun and Aswin walk up to the massive file storage and Aswin opens a drawer. 

Aswin 
Dang it, it isn’t labeled by student name. Only Purdue ID number and project name!

Arun 
I guess we are just going have to go through each drawer and see if there’s anything suspicious

Aswin 
You start from that end

Arun and Aswin start going through the files. Time lapse to show how much time has passed as there are an extensive amount of files. 

Arun 
Aswin! Over here.. 


Aswin 
What is it?

Arun 
There’s a file titled: ‘Project C’

Aswin
Interesting… Open it

Arun slowly opens the file and breaks the seal, only to reveal that the file is completely empty. 

Arun 
No!

Arun rapidly searches through each pocket of the large file but nothing is there. Suddenly, a loud swing is heard and the door to the room is opened. 

Arun and Aswin turn their heads quickly in fear. Close up on Arun and Aswin’s fear filled eyes

Stranger
Put your hands up now!

Cut to end credits

End of credits: 

Text: The previous night

Cut to Arun and Aswin running out of Stuart. They race up the stairs past a clock that reads 8:30pm. The camera focuses on the clock. They dash out the Stuart door across the PMU. Arun and Aswin stop in their tracks. They look up and see Jason walking across in front of the PMU 

Aswin 
There he is!

Arun and Aswin follow Jason but maintain a safe distance

Camera moves from Arun and Aswin to Jason who is 30ft ahead. 

Suddenly, Jason stops. He gets a call and picks it up. 

Voice on phone
You’re being followed

Cut to Jason’s intense eyes

Jason
Hm

Voice on phone
Abort meeting. Find a way to throw them off

Jason 
On it

Jason hangs up and as he is walking, he texts some friends asking to get boba. His friends text back, saying they’re in the area. Jason puts his phone back. He pulls out a vial with some clear substance inside, stares at it, and smiles. 
Drone shot: The camera moves and gradually zooms out, revealing Arun and Aswin trailing Jason through the streets, with the PMU in the background. The shot continues to rise, offering a bird’s-eye view of the cityscape. The camera shifts focus toward the top of a nearby building and zooms in on a window.
Cut to: Inside the room a figure stands by the window, looking down at the street, a phone pressed to their ear. The figure remains turned away from the camera, gazing outside in silence. After a moment, they end the call and slip the phone into their pocket.
The camera pans slowly across the room, revealing a massive, sleek, high-tech machine. It's composed of dark, metallic panels, faintly glowing with neon blue lines that pulse rhythmically, indicating the flow of energy. Several interconnected cylindrical components surround a central core. The core is suspended within a rotating ring, which spins continuously, giving off a mechanical sound.
Complex wiring runs along the floor, converging at the base of the machine. Tubes filled with a glowing fluid wrap around the device, feeding into the rotating core. Small screen displays on the side show various charts and diagnostic readings.
Zoom in: A close-up shot of the machine’s main display shows the words: “Project C: 90% complete.” Above it, a countdown timer ticks slowly toward zero, adding a subtle tension to the scene.
