Reflections



Arun rapidly searches through each pocket of the large file but nothing is there. Suddenly, a loud swing is heard and the door to the room is opened. 

Arun and Aswin turn their heads quickly in fear. Close up of Arun and Aswin’s fear ridden eyes

Stranger
Put your hands up now!

Cut to Arun and Aswin’s frightened and alarmed expressions. They quickly crouch under a nearby table. The sound of their heavy, nervous panting fills the tense silence, heightening the sense of danger.

The camera slowly pans up from the feet of the mysterious figure, revealing a pair of jeans and canvas sneakers. As the camera continues its ascent, a Columbia jacket comes into view. The camera moves to a modified gun gripped in the figure’s hand. The gun has a vial attached to its base, glowing faintly. Next the camera slowly if moves up and reveals the man’s cold, sharp eyes. Finally, the camera slowly zooms out to reveal his face with a blank and mean expression . 

Reveal: The stranger is Aswin 

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

Cut to Jason walking out of the research lab. He is holding files titled ‘Project C.’ The camera zooms in to show his tense expression as he secures the files in a briefcase. He cautiously glances around, making sure he isn’t being followed, and continues down the street into the darkness. The camera then shifts back to the research lab behind Jason, slowly zooming toward the rooftop, where Arun and Aswin are facing danger.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Close up on Aswin’s facial expression transitioning from fear to shock. He is unable to believe his eyes. 

Cut to: Split screen of both Aswins side by side. Aswin 1 and Arun are shaken up and visibly shocked, while Aswin 2 stares with cold, unblinking eyes. Aswin 2 is emotionless. No background music. The tension builds naturally, thick in the air.
Suddenly, Aswin 2 lunges and swings his fist at Aswin 1 at breathtaking speed. 
Aswin 1 barely ducks, eyes wide in disbelief. Before he can react further, Aswin 2 spins and drives a powerful kick into Aswin 1's chest. The impact sends Aswin 1 flying backward, crashing into a table with a pained groan.
Arun moves to help, but freezes. Aswin 2 turns his cold gaze toward him. His eyes shift between calculating and menacing. Aswin 2 throws a kick at Arun's chest with precise force. As he kicks, a phone flies out of Aswin 2’s pocket. Arun flies backward 10 feet and hits the back shelf. The shelf comes crashing down on him. 
Struggling to his feet, Aswin 1 watches in horror as Aswin 2 effortlessly pivots, throwing another strike at him. Aswin 1 tries to block, but Aswin 2's strength overpowers him. The force of the punch sends Aswin 1 staggering back, clutching his side in pain. Aswin 2 lets out a terrorizing, maniacal laugh.
Breathing heavily, Aswin 1 throws a desperate punch, but it lands weakly against Aswin 2's chest, barely making an impact. Aswin 2 doesn’t flinch. His emotionless face remains unmoved. Aswin 2 smiles. 
Aswin 2 grabs Aswin 1 by the collar and lifts him off the ground and slams him hard into the wall. Aswin 1 gasps in pain, completely overpowered. Aswin 2’s eyes are piercing. 
Arun, dazed, notices a phone lying on the ground a few feet away. Arun discreetly reaches for it, fingers trembling as he picks it up.
Aswin 2 raises his fist, preparing to deliver the final blow to Aswin 1. Arun grabs a text book off a nearby table and starts charging towards Aswin 2. With a sudden burst of adrenaline, Aswin 1 twists out of Aswin 2’s grip just as Arun slams the textbook at the back of Aswin 2’s head. Aswin 2 stumbles in pain, clutching his head. Together, they bolt toward the door, racing away from Aswin 2, who is struggling to regain his consciousness. 
As they dash through the narrow hallway, Aswin 1 glances back, panting 
Aswin 
He’s too strong… It’s me, but…but.. Stronger!

Arun 
How is this even possible, it’s like an actual copy of you 

Aswin gives a tense look back at the building. 

Arun and Aswin continue to run out the building 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to Jason walking by the PMU. He walks across the street and enters a building. He enters an elevator and takes it to the top of the building. He walks into a room. 

Jason 
Boss

Stranger
Ah Jason

Jason hands off the briefcase to his boss. The stranger’s face is not revealed. 

Stranger
And I assume Agent C is taking care of the intruders?

Jason
Yes sir. He must be finished with them by now

Stranger
Good. 

The camera zooms away from the interaction and on to the nearby machine making a mechanical noise. Close up on the display of the machine, which reads: ‘Project  C: 98%’


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location: AAARCC basement, Captain C/SIA headquarters. The gang is sitting around a table. Everyone looks exhausted and tense.

Aadit
What are you saying? A.. a…. clone of Aswin? 

Rishika 
Like a copy?
AswinEyes sunk and still shaken from the encounterHe wasn’t just a copy... He was stronger, faster, more calculated..
Hitha
Stronger than you?

Arun 
He was a killing machine.. Something out of your worst nightmares. 

The group goes silent, stunned while attempting to process what has just happened. 

Sai Aiswarya
This is traumatizing 

Aadit
You said you saw Jason at the research lab… What if that Jason is another lookalike as well?

Rishika
Or what if the Jason that came to dance practice is the copy

Aswin 
That could make sense. The Jason we saw at the research lab had a bigger beard compared to the one at dance practice 

Arun 
Could making these Clones be what Project C is all about?

Aswin 
I don’t think so… I have a feeling Project C is going to be something very destructive 

Negha 
Pacing around the room, tapping her fingers on her chin
We’ve done some investigation and looked back at the night Sanjana and those other students were kidnapped... And we’ve found something weird

Negha places a printed list of names on the table. Priya gestures to it.
Sai AiswaryaPointing to the namesEveryone who was taken that night – they were all engineers or scientists. Mechanical, chemical, biomedical... all fields tied to innovation and technology. It’s as if they were specifically targeting people with engineering skills
Aswin
Intriguing ..

Sanjana
Furrowing her brow, confused
But that doesn’t make sense. I’m a business analytics information management major. Why take me?

There’s a moment of silence as the group ponders Sanjana’s words.
PriyaNods slowly, putting the pieces togetherThat’s what’s been bothering us. Remember the Dakshin Chef—Durai Singam. He said something strange during the victim statement... He mentioned that the boss, whoever that is, was especially interested in kidnapping Sanjana
Hitha
What if it’s personal?

Aadit
What do you mean 

Hitha
What if she was kidnapped as a means of getting revenge? 

Rishika
What if her kidnapping was irrelevant to ‘Project C’? The rest of the victims were kidnapped to work on the project. But Sanjana was targeted for some other reason. . . 

Aswin 
That would mean.. Whoever this boss is.. The person in charge of Project C… The criminal mastermind of West Lafayette… 

Negha 
Is someone close to us..

The group goes silent in shock. The camera slowly pans around the group, capturing their expressions of confusion and worry. Sanjana sits quietly, deep in thought.

Sai Aiswarya 
This is once again traumatizing 

Sanjana
Whispering to herself
What do they want from me?

The camera moves out as the gang sits in contemplative silence, the weight of the mystery growing heavier.

Suddenly, A phone rings from Arun’s pocket. The group is startled by the disruption to the silence. Arun quickly pulls out the phone and reads the caller name: ‘Jason 3.’ The group is shocked. 


Arun 
This phone, I got it from the copy of Aswin!

Rishika
So does this confirm it? There are clones?

Priya
And there’s more than one Jason?

Hitha
Then what about the real Jason?

Aswin reaches for the phone and picks up the call on speaker

Silence … 

Aswin 
Hello?

Jason 3
Agent C? 

Aswin 
Yes

Jason 3
Project C. 99%. 45 till project launch. Come headquarters. 

Aswin 
Ok…. Where are you 

Jason 3 pauses 

Jason 3
Russel St intersection. Turning. 

Aswin hangs up

Aswin 
That could mean he’s walking along Mitch Daniel’s Blvd. Maybe walking towards PMU?

Sai Aiswarya
Who is Agent C?

Arun 
Must be that ruthless killer we just fought at the lab, the clone of Aswin!

Sai Aiswarya
My goodness

Priya 
What’s the plan?

Aswin 
I’ll pretend to be the clone and meet with this Jason. Hopefully this will bring me to their headquarters, so I can finally encounter and take down the mastermind behind ‘Project C.’

Negha
He mentioned that Project C will be finished in 45 minutes. What might this project entail? What magnitude of terror could it unleash on this city? Oh no…. 

Aswin 
We’re about to find out.. Arun, Priya, and Sanjana, let’s go. 

The gang puts their hands in the middle. 

Aswin 
‘SIA on three!’ 

Group 
1..2..3… SIA!

Slow motion shot of Aswin, Arun, Priya, and Sanjana walking out of the AAARCC with Captain C theme music

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arun, Aswin, Priya, and Sanjana are walking along Mitch Daniels Blvd. They have spotted Jason 3 and are following him. They follow him as he enters Hawkins dorm and meets up with another Jason clone. They observe the interaction from a window

Priya
My goodness, He’s talking to a copy of himself!

Sanjana
Are either of them even the real Jason?

Aswin 
I’ll go in and act as Agent C. If they catch on that I’m the real Aswin, come in for back up. Otherwise, follow from a distance

Arun, Priya, Sanjana
Got it, chief

Aswin 
It’s Chettiar Time! 

Aswin leaves the group and walks inside Hawkins. Arun, Priya, and Sanjana spy from the corner of a window that reveals the Hawkins lobby 

From Arun, Priya, Sanjana window POV: They watch Aswin as he walks in Hawkins and shakes hands with Jason 3. Suddenly, another Jason joins the group.

Cut to Aswin and the two Jasons. 

Jason 3
Agent C, it’s time. Project C is nearly here. A year long journey 

Aswin tries to embody a robotic persona similar to Agent C. Aswin eyes Jason 3

Jason 2
I have some cloning work to get back to downstairs. I’ll come up after 

Jason 3 nods and gestures to Aswin toward the elevator. Jason 2 separates from them and moves across the room. Aswin signals to the trio outside the window with hand signals: two should follow Jason 2, and one should support Aswin. The trio acknowledges with a nod.

As the elevator closes with Jason 3 and Aswin inside up to the 11th floor of Hawkins, Sanjana takes a different elevator up. Aswin texts Sanjana the floor number. Meanwhile, Arun and Priya begin to follow Jason 2 who takes the stairs downstairs into the basement. 

Aswin and Jason 2 go up the elevator while in a split screen, Arun and Priya follow Jason 3 down the basement. 

Jason 3 taps the basement wall three times, snaps once, and claps twice. Suddenly, the wall flips open, and Jason 3 steps inside. Priya and Arun quickly dash forward and do a cartwheel through the opening just as it closes. They swiftly hide behind a pillar and glimpse at a scientific lab with a machine at the far end. They watch as Jason 3 approaches the machine, noticing various people in test tubes connected to the machine, with percentage signs displayed in front of each one. The test tubes are filled with a bubbling, glowing liquid, and faint humming sounds emanate from the machine. Engulfed in the liquid are emerging life forms.

Arun 
Whispering 
Clones…

Priya nods 

Suddenly, a cold hand reaches out and grips Arun's shoulder. A jolt of fear courses through Arun, and he jumps, heart racing as he spins around to confront the unknown presence lurking behind him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aswin steps out of the elevator with Jason 2, and they enter a dimly lit dorm room, shutting the door behind them with a soft click. Sanjana follows closely, pressing her ear against the door, straining to catch any sound from within.
Inside the room, Aswin glances around, his eyes drawn to a machine that emits an unsettling mechanical whirring. The display ominously reads: Project C: 30 minutes : 99%. In the faint light, a man in a suit stands by the window, gazing out at the fading sunset over the PMU, a shadowy silhouette against the glowing sky. Just as he begins to turn, the camera abruptly cuts away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene opens outside the AAARCC, where the sun is about to set, casting the sky in eerie shades of gray. The camera follows a man as he walks down 5th Street. As he turns slightly, his identity is revealed: it’s Agent C.
The camera shifts to focus on his hands, gripping a massive ax in each hand. With deliberate slowness, he ascends the steps of the AAARCC, each footfall echoing like a foreboding heartbeat.
As the camera moves up to his face, a chilling smile spreads across his lips, revealing a murderous intent.
The scene cuts to the inside of the AAARCC, where the rest of the SIA gang—Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Rishika, Hitha, and Aadit—are buried in their homework, completely oblivious to Agent C outside the AAARCC front door, who intends to kill them all.
