Recap: The SIA Guardians follow the trail of clues and uncover the AI which is used as a tool by Hisham. They interact with the AI, and discover that Operation N is a plot to rescue Nidarshan from jail. The cult plans to activate the ancient chettiar rocks on the day of the eclipse, and insert them into the chettiar blaster- a mass destructive weapon. The guardians start their journey to Lagoda, but Hisham’s cult is tipped off by Jiapei. Hisham moves his camp to Brownsburg park. On the way to the park, the guardians recreate the serum that is used to free cult members from the curse. They load this serum in water guns. When they arrive in Lagoda, the park is empty and the cult is nowhere to be found. They are heartbroken and pathless, sulking in the fear that Hisham will complete Operation N unopposed and eventually rescue Nidarshan. And then suddenly, the sun grows brighter, and the light seems to be getting closer…

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hisham lays out 10 red Chettiar rocks out on the grass on a straw bamboo mat. Sahil, Anurag, and the Bride surround him. His cult of 30 stands behind him with a knee on the ground.

Hisham 
Once these rocks are activated by the eclipse phenomenon, we can grind them up, and then load the powder into our Chettiar blasters.

Anurag opens up the suitcases in their hands. Inside are three uniquely colored, intricate guns.

Hisham looks down at his watch, which reads a countdown. 

Hisham 
1 hour till the eclipse. 

Hisham turns back and looks at the cult. 

Hisham 
Everyone, positions!

The 30 cult members scramble to the ground and bow down to Hisham. Sahil, Anurag, and the Bride do the same.

Hisham stylishly removes his sunglasses. Then, in superstar style, he stylishly puts on his eclipse glasses. 

Hisham opens his arms wide and raises his hands towards the sun. Hisham's lips twist and curl into an evil smile.

Hisham 
Nidarshan, today, you will once again be free!

Hisham raises his hand in a fist.

Hisham 
For Nidarshan!

The cultists repeat after him in the chant. As the chants of Nidarshan’s name echoes, the camera moves out and the drone hovers over the park. 

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Captain C and the SIA Guardians are devastated. They all depressingly sit in the grass, on the verge of losing. The information from Jiapei informed them that this would be the site of the rock activation.

One hour till the eclipse. The sky has begun to get darker. The eclipse is nearing….

Hitha
It was dark all this time, but why does it feel like the sky is getting brighter? 

The sky slowly turns brighter, ridding itself of grey. 

Suddenly, from the direction of the sun, a bright light starts to emerge, and gets closer, and closer, and closer. 

A bright ball of orange and yellow land before the SIA guardians. The guardians squint in confusion, trying to make out what this phenomenon may be. 

Suddenly, the ball of magic dissipates into mist. Out of this mist appear 9 elderly Indian men, dressed in veshti and older style clothing. The eldest man stands in the middle of these men. He takes a step forward. 

Aswin and Arun suddenly feel a jolt in their stomachs. Their conscience has been altered. It was as if a cheetah was racing through each of their bloodstreams, searching for the way out. 

The eldest man walks forward and puts each of his hands on the shoulders of Arun and Aswin. 

“Don’t worry young boys, that feeling is nothing but your Chettiar Sense”

Arun stares at him in confusion.

“Chettiar Sense is that feeling, special connection a Chettiar feels in many moments of sensitivity. This may be when he or she encounters a Chettiar in the wild, or if he or she is in danger”

Aswin 
Who are you? 

Man 
I am Chidambaram. I am the Chettiar elder. And these men around me make up the Chettiar Council. 

Aswin 
Chettiar Council? But the council no longer exists! The last remaining council wa  in s wiped out during the disaster of 2001!

Chidambaram 
Yes, but we are not just any council. We are the original council, the very first council of Chettiars. 

Aswin and Arun’s eyes display alarm. They immediately drop to the ground and touch the feet of Chidambaram. 

Chidambaram 
Be well boys

Arun 
How are you all here, how are you all alive?

Chidambaram 
When we passed away, the council passed on to new hands. Meanwhile, we the original council, joined one with the sun god Suriyan. During an eclipse, a pathway is made to earth from the sun. On this eclipse, help was needed, so we came down to assist you all. 

Aswin 
But it’s all over! We have no idea where Hisham and his cult is! They are going to activate the rock and use the Chettiar Blaster to break out Nidarshan!

Chidambaram 
Son, it is only over if you believe it is over. Look at us, we were stranded in sea on the way back from Burma. Our belief in Pilayar got us out of that situation.

Arun 
You all are the founders of Pilayar Nombu?!?

Chidambaram 
Yes we are. 

Aswin 
Unreal 

Chidambaram 
That’s not all as to who we are. Young stallion Aswin, you are my ancestor. I am your long distance grandfather. 

The corner of Aswin’s eyes start to form tears. He immediately runs forward and tightly hugs Chidambaram. 

Chidambaram 
Ouch!

Aswin backs away. 

Chidambaram 
Glancing to his right 
And Arunachalam over there…

Arunachalam walks over to Arun, adjusting his veshti. He wears a rudraacham Maalai. Arunachalam stands before Arun. 

Arunachalam 
And you young Lion, are my grandson

Arun bows down in respect, touching Arunachalam’s feet.  

Chidambaram 
We have been watching over you all from the start. It warms my heart to see my descendant fighting alongside my best friend’s descendant. We fought along each other against the British back in the day. 

Arunachalam motions towards the rest of the SIA Guardians



Arunachalam 
The bravery you all have shown is stunning. The reason this country is safe is a testament to all of your Bravery, hard work, and friendship. 

Chidambaram 
We would like to make you all honorary Chettiars. And with that, you can join in on our traditions and identity.

The SIA guardians bow in respect. 

Chidambaram opens up a silver box. Inside are nine sweets, with a string in each of them. Arunachalam lights the sweets on fire. 

Arunachalam 
Each of you, eat this with the fire!

The SIA guardians each line up and eat the sweet. 

Chidambaram 
Now, you all are the fire

Suddenly, Aswin’s feet lift off the ground. He begins hovering above the ground. The rest of the SIA guardians begin floating as well.

Rishika
Wow, we can fly!

Sai Aiswarya
This is traumaflying!

Negha
Now I can fly to Tsacoaa!

Chidambaram 
This ability will only last for the next 20 minutes, beware…

Arun 
We can fly, but how do we know where to fly to?

Arunachalam 
Follow your heart, Arun. Let your Chettiar sense guide you… 

Arun and Aswin close their eyes. They track the Chettiar sense within their bodies. Suddenly, they jolt in the south east direction. 

Aswin 
That way! They’re that way!

Chidambaram
I trust you all can complete this mission, and return West Lafayette, and the world, to peace… Now go on!

Arunachalam 
Best wishes! And remember the elephant god!

The SIA guardians begin flying behind Aswin and Arun, who take the lead, guided by their Chettiar Sense. They fly with the water guns, loaded with the serum, in their hands. 

The guardians fly all the way over trees, residential areas, and corn fields. They finally reach their destination, a park. 

Williams Park. Brownsburg. Indiana.

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

The Battle of Brownsburg 


The sky is now darker. Gray. The shade of gray that screams evil. Hisham stands staring at the sky. Sahil and the bride stand beside him. The cult is lined up in formation before them. Hisham looks down at his watch. 

20 minutes to go. 

Hisham 
It’s almost time… 

Suddenly, he looks into the distance. A group of nine is walking towards him. 

Hisham 
Squinting 
Who could that be….

The group gets closer. Their faces become clear.

Hisham 
Furiously 
SIA! Jai! Jai Jai Jai Jai!

Hisham falls to his knees. Infront of him, on the grass, lie 10 chettiar rocks and 3 chettiar blasters on the mat. 

Hisham 
CHARGE!

The cultists all charge at the guardians. Hisham stands behind, protecting the items on the mat. 

The camera zooms forward to the guardians. Aswin leads the gang, all with eclipse glasses on. 

Negha
The flying power has worn out.

Aadit
Now, we must use our fighting power. 

Aswin 
It’s Chettiar Time!

The crowd of cultists all charge forward at the guardians.

The guardians all have their water guns aimed forward. They spray the guns at the enemies. When the serum hits the face of the enemies, they break free of the trance, returning to their normal form. 

Slowly, 20 of the cultists that attacked first are cured. The 10 behind them realize the danger, and start to run away. They retreat to the playground. 

The guardians continue their battle.

Aadit jumps from the top of the play structure to the bottom, and in the process takes out an enemy with the water gun.

Rishika and Hitha each kick an enemy to the ground. They spray the serum.

Aswin watches from the swings in entertainment. 

Negha and Sai Aiswarya punch two enemies to the spinning structure. They spin the two guys continuously until they lose consciousness from dizziness. Then the duo cures the entranced enemies. 

Sanjana kicks a guy in the air and then sprays him with the serum. 

The SIA guardians turn back to the swing and see Aswin.

Negha
Are you not flighting 

Aswin 
You guys were doing a pretty good-

Aswin falls backwards off the swing and hits the ground. 

Sahil and the Bride enter the playground. 

The bride pounces on Negha and starts scratching her. Negha yells in terror and starts to scratch her back.

Aswin 
Cat fight!

Priya points her gun at the Bride and cures her. 

The Bride
When is the wedding happening?

Meanwhile, Sahil and Arun are engaged in a tense stand off. Sahil delivers a kick, but Arun dodges, does a flip, and then punches Sahil to the ground. Rishika sprays Sahil with her gun.

Sahil 
Thank you for saving me.

The guardians leave the scene in search of Hisham. They find hovered over a mat filled with chettiar rocks and chettiar blasters. The rocks have partly changed color, into pure shining gold. 

Hisham looks at his watch.



Hisham 
Crying
But only 1 minute to go! Why?!?!

Aswin 
Hisham, your time is over. Nidarshan will remain in jail, and now you will join him.

Arun 
Never underestimate the power of a Chettiar

Hisham 
How did you all do it? I have an army of 30!

Aswin 
And we got something called Kampung Spirit.

The moon covers the sun. The eclipse has begun. The sky is completely dark. The rocks begin floating to the sky. The rocks turn completely gold, and then start to get brighter and brighter. Nobody can see a thing. This lasts for a minute, before the eclipse comes to an end. The rocks float back down to the ground, now completely gold in color. 

The sounds of sirens blare through the park as police rush to the scene. Hisham is put in handcuffs as the SIA Guardians watch. 

A police chief walks over to the guardians.

Chief
My name is Charles. What are the dangerous weapons you all mentioned in the call?

Aswin brings Charles over to the mat. 

Aswin 
Here they are sir, have a very good day

Charles counts the nine chettiar rocks and two chettiar blasters. 

Charles 
Is it everything in this mat?

Aswin 
Yes sir, have a nice day. 


Charles 
Thanks for the help, Captain.

Aswin 
No problem sir, have a very nice night.

Arun 
We have to make it back in time for the National Championship game! 

Sai Aiswarya 
And we have to finish our Shell project in Rawls!

Aswin 
First we have to eat at Bob’s Indian Kitchen!

The guardians leave the park, and embark on the journey back to Purdue University.

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—
INT. TRIPLE XXX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Aswin and his friends are gathered around a large table in the bustling Triple XXX Restaurant. Plates of food and drinks cover the table. The group is animated, laughing and joking around.
MEDIUM SHOT: THE WHOLE GROUP
The camaraderie and warmth among them are palpable. Aswin looks around the table, a content smile on his face. Arun, Priya, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Hitha, Rishika, and Aadit are all around him. He then turns to face the camera.
ASWIN 
“Friendship is everything. It’s the family we choose, the people who stand by us no matter what.”
Aswin winks at the camera
The screen begins to darken, with a circle closing in on Aswin's wink.
FADE TO BLACK.
TEXT ON SCREEN: To be continued…

Post Credits:

It is past midnight. The camera follows bus 23, the connector as it reaches its final destination: The Tippecanoe County Jail. A man with curly hair exits the bus with a bag.

Camera cuts to a cell inside the jail. A man sits in an isolated jail cell. He looks defeated and worn out. He punches the wall, demonstrating his rage and will to escape. The camera moves around him in a 360, to reveal his face. 

Nidarshan continues to punch the cell wall in frustration. 

Nidarshan 
I. NEED. TO. BE. FREE!!!

A voice speaks through the other side of the wall Nidarshan is punching. In the adjacent jail cell. 

“Punching that wall itself has made you so much stronger in the last few months.”

Through a small gap in the wall, Nidarshan speaks to the inmate in the neighboring jail cell. 

Nidarshan 
It’s only a matter of time my friend… My boy will be here anytime by now. Soon, we will join hands and spread our ideology, our mission across this damned world…

“Meeting you in this jail was the greatest thing that has happened to me. All this time my anger and strength have gotten me in and out of jail without purpose. Only now, after meeting you, my strength has a new purpose”

Nidarshan 
When we get out, we’re going to have to be on the low. Right now we are not in a position to fight, we’re weak and lack an army. But later, could be months, me and you, we will come back even stronger than before. 

“And the world will be in both of our hands”

The camera moves through the hole in the wall to reveal the inmate on the other side. The man has his shirt off and is incredibly muscular. He seems like he could lift an entire truck off the ground and throw it in the air. His muscles flex as he leans across the wall and talks to Nidarshan. 



Nidarshan 
My friend, if I had you last February, I would not even be in this cell, rotting. I have never seen more strength in a human than the power that you possess. You might as well be one of the strongest people to walk this soil. Hopefully my boys are successful in their mission at Lagoda. 

Camera zooms in through the hole in the wall, on the sly smile of the man on the other side of the cell. 

“Yes partner”

Suddenly, a laser cuts through the wall of Nidarshan’s jail cell. A massive human-sized circle chunk of the wall crumbles down, revealing Anurag with a ChettiarBlaster on the other side. 

Anurag 
Chief, there has been a situation. SIA got us again. 

Nidarshan 
NO!

Anurag 
In the commotion of the rocks activating, I managed to escape with these two rocks. 

Nidarshan
What has happened has happened. We must move on. 

Anurag 
We have to move quickly, before the Jailer catches us. 

Nidarshan 
Wait.. We have a new alliance. He will be the key to our second coming. 

Nidarshan grabs the Chettiar Blaster from Anurag and uses it to expand the small hole in the wall into a bigger one. The wall crumbles down to reveal the man on the other side of the cell. 

Chawin stands through the gap, intensely flexing his muscles with terror. 

Chawin shakes Nidarshan’s hand, the two connected now not just by ideology, but also physically. 


Nidarshan
I am the secret hitler.

Nidarshan, Chawin, and Anurag escape the jail unnoticed and venture into the dark, ready to start their new journey.
