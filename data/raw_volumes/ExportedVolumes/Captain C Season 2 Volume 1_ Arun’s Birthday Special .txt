Captain C Season 2 Volume 1

Arun walks across the bridge over the Wabash river. He glances over the bridge and smiles as he admires the magnificent, breathtaking view. The beauty of the bridge was unimaginable; it was as if a million butterflies performed a coordinated dance routine choreographed by Negha. 

Arun
Halfway through my fourth semester… This semester has been a blur to say the least. All starting with meeting Aswin at the AAARCC, discovering I wasn’t the only chettiar, and then training in the way of the chettiar. Over a month has passed since the real challenge we faced: putting a stop to Nidarshan’s Project C.

Arun sighs

Arun 
Nidarshan is in jail. This city is finally calm. But how long will it take for a new threat to emerge? 

Arun sighs and looks at the sky 

Arun 
These days of peace and tranquility, I’ll cherish them now. Because when danger approaches, I know I’ll be the first in line to stop it. 

Suddenly, Arun’s phone rings. Arun reaches for his pocket and pulls his phone out. 

Aswin(On Phone)
Arun, hurry up! They’re calling you for dance practice. This is the second to last practice before the mock Kalyanam on Sunday!

Arun 
Oh, Jai! I’m on my way!

Arun puts his head down and starts jogging past the fountain and up the hill as the camera moves up from Arun and up to the sunset. As the camera focuses on the sun setting in the clouds….

They finish the last step where everyone turns around in circles and the music comes to an end. 

Negha

Arun faces Rohit

Arun 
I think I got all the steps down 

Rohit 
Yeah, same. I think we’re fine. Two days to practice

Arun 
Sounds good

Cut to Aswin

Aswin
So now….  Mango, Mango time?

Negha
Why do you always want Boba?

Aswin 
Look who’s talking 

The group packs up their stuff and walks out of the room 

Rohit
I’ll see you guys later, I’ve gotta play poker

Arun 
Oh ok. See you bruh 

Rohit walks away as the group walks over to Mango Mango. They cross the PMU and walk by the University Bookstore when suddenly, Negha’s phone rings.

Negha
Hello?

Negha stops in her tracks while everyone walks by her. When they realize she is still behind, they turn around and meet her shocked expression. Negha is on the verge of tears.

Negha looks up at the group while the group is watching her.

Aswin 
Negha, what is it?

Negha
The bride… she’s…she’s… she’s disappeared!
