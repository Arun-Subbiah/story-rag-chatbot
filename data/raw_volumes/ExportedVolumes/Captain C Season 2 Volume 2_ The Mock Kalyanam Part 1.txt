Setting: The sun is setting. AAARCC, the day before the mock kalyanam. It is the day of the mehendi/snacks fundraiser. Currently, Sai Aiswarya and Hitha are applying mehendi to the bride’s friends at the table between the kitchen and living room. The bride’s friends are crying, concerned about the whereabouts of their friend. 

Sai Aiswarya
Don’t worry, the cops will find her soon 

Hitha 
It’s going to be alright, she will be back before the event!

Camera moves from the room to the kitchen, where Sanjana and Negha are in deep conversation. 

Negha
What do we do? Should we cancel the event?

Sanjana
Possibly…

Negha
But we’ve put so much money into this

Sanjana
Hopefully the bride comes back soon

Negha
Does the groom even know about this?

Sanjana
Nobody told him!? The groom isn’t supposed to see the bride until the day of the wedding!

Negha
Oh no… This is such a mess. 

Sanjana
Who even called you last night to break this news?

Negha
I don’t even know, I think the police? It was an unknown number… 

Camera moves from the kitchen to the living room, where Arun and Aswin sit on the couch watching the news. Currently, a commercial is playing. 

Arun 
Want to go to the mall

Aswin 
Yeah, I need pants for tomorrow 

Camera follows Arun and Aswin leaving the AAARCC, as the camera shows them walking out the front door. Camera then moves back and focuses on the tv. The ad break is over, and the news segment has resumed. 

News Anchor
Here, live in Purdue University, a total of 12 students have been reported missing over the past two days. Police are currently investigating the situation. 

Camera cuts to Arun and Aswin in the car on the way to the mall, unaware of the situation on campus. 

Camera close up on Arun 

Arun
Thinking
Could the disappearance of the bride be something serious? Project C is over and Nidarshan is in jail. Did the bride just want to step away from the world for a bit? Or is she in actual danger?… 

Camera close up on Aswin 

Aswin 
Thinking 
What type of snacks should I buy at the mall food court?…

Setting: It is now dark. Aswin has parked the car and Aswin and Arun are walking past the garden and into the AAARCC side entrance. Aswin walks into the kitchen. 

Sanjana is cleaning up the kitchen, while Sai Aiswarya and Hitha are cleaning up the mehendi. 


Aswin 
Where’s Negha?

Sanjana
I thought she went with you guys? I haven’t seen her in over an hour!

Aswin’s eyes display alarm

Aswin calls Negha repeatedly, but there is no response. Aswin runs out of the AAARCC and Arun follows him. They both yell Negha around the area, but she is nowhere to be found. Arun and Aswin split up and check every corner of the campus over the next two hours. However, she is nowhere to be found. 

Arun and Aswin run and meet up near the belltower, the midpoint of their sides of the search. 

There are tears in their eyes. 

Aswin yells at the sky 

Arun kicks some nearby rocks 

Arun 
Should we tell the others?

Aswin 
Not yet… There's a big event tomorrow and it's already 12 am. They’re all probably asleep. And also, sometimes she just goes away for some time. If she’s still gone by tomorrow, we’ll declare an SIA red alarm. 

Arun 
Ok… meanwhile, should we check past the bridge? In Lafayette?

Aswin 
Sounds like a plan.

Camera follows Arun and Aswin jogging down the campus as the camera fades to black. 

Text: The Next Day

Setting: Corec feature gym. The SIA board is setting up the mock kalyanam. Arun and Aswin walk in, their eyes red from staying up all night. The decorations are nearly completed. 
Aadit
Where were you guys?

Rishika
Anyone know where Negha is?

Priya
We haven't seen her all day…

The SIA guardians surround Arun and Aswin, desperate for answers. Arun and Aswin look at each other before Aswin starts to speak. 

Aswin 
There’s something we haven’t told you guys… Negha…Negha…She’s… She’s missi-

Suddenly, the door slams open.

Negha walks through the door, dressed in her green and pink sari. The bride is right beside her. Both girls are expressionless. Their faces are pale, white as a ghost. 

Negha and the bride walk over to the group.

Sanjana
Negha, where were you? We were all so worried

Negha stares, her face still blank. 

A bridesmaid walks up to the group. 

Bridesmaid
Oh my god! I was so scared! Thank goodness you’re back

The bridesmaid hugs the bride 

The bride does not hug her back. Her face is still blank. She continues to stare into the distance. 

The group nervously chuckles, confused by Negha and the bride’s weird behavior. 

Hitha
So Negha, what do you think of the decorations?

Negha looks up at Hitha and blankly stares

Negha opens her mouth and starts whispering something that the group can not hear. The bride joins in and does the same. The group tries to make out what they are whispering, but the sound is so faint and unhearable. 

Everyone looks around at each other, now actually concerned by the situation. 

Sai Aiswarya looks at Arun 

Sai Aiswarya
Are we being trolled?

Arun blankly shakes his head, his eyes displaying terror

Sai Aiswarya
My goodness this is traumatizing!

Negha and the bride separate and walk in opposite ways as the gang stands lost in the confusion of what has just happened. 

Cut to the Corec area with the giant TV and chairs across from the pool. Arun is sitting with Aswin. They are watching the news on the TV. 

News Anchor
The 12 students that were reported missing have been found and are safe. Police say this may have just been a coincidence and no foul play was involved. These students may have just wanted a break. 

Aswin glances at Arun 

Aswin 
That would mean Negha is the 13th student to go missing 

Arun 
Unlucky 13. 

Aswin 
What is wrong with them? They go missing for a night or two and suddenly turn mad!

Arun 
Something happened over the last two nights, something must have happened!

Aswin 
I’m going to go talk to Negha

Aswin gets up from his chair and walks back inside the feature gym. It is almost time for the mock kalyanam to begin. Aswin sees Negha sitting by herself in the far corner of the room, staring blankly at the floor. Aswin walks over to her. 

Aswin 
Negha, what’s wrong? What’s gotten into you?!

Negha does not respond and continues to stare. 

Shot of Negha sitting on the bench while Aswin stands in front of her. Negha is still continuously whispering the chant. 

Aswin
Negha, respond! This isn’t funny! Are you safe? Where were you last night?!

The camera slowly moves closer and closer to Negha. Slowly, her whispering gets more audible as the camera moves closer to her face. 

Negha
Whispering 
…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI….

Aswin still can not make out what she is saying and stands with impatience

Aswin 
Negha, that’s enough! This is not a joke, this is the last straw. Answer me now!

Aswin claps his hands loudly near Negha’s face

Negha slowly moves her head up and stares blankly at Aswin. Aswin stares back, with paranoia. 

Negha opens her mouth 

Negha
I love 2 good. 
FADE TO BLACK.
