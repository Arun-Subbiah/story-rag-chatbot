Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------——

Setting: The Corec Feature Gym. The Mock Kalyanam event is in full swing and the guests are seated, preparing to watch the dance performance. The dancers are standing on the sides of the stage, waiting for Sanjana to finish speaking before they go on to perform. 

Vachinde starts playing. The girls gracefully showcase their moves. 

DJ Tillu plays next: The boys show they can compete.

Jimikki Kamal follows: The girls and boys join together.

Suvvi Suvali starts: A glimpse of Kannada quirkiness

Maamadura to finish it off: A burst of energy to conclude months of hard work 

The dancers fall to the ground as the music comes to an end. 

Sai Aiswarya looks at Sanjana and they both look at Negha. Negha is still in a trance-like state.

Sai Aiswarya
She must have completed the whole performance in this state

Sanjana
Unreal… but seriously- what is wrong with her?

As Sai Aiswarya, Sanjana, and the rest of the dancers begin to stand up, the lights go out with a crack. The gym is pitch black. A couple of guests let out squeals of panic. 

Aswin 
It’s alright everyone, I’ll go check on the lights

Suddenly, the lights start flickering for a few seconds, before going out dark again. 

Aswin looks up at the lights, eyeing them suspiciously 

Aswin turns to Arun 

Aswin 
Something is wrong 

Arun 
Seriously wrong

Suddenly, a projector attached to the ceiling is slowly lowered down. The projector starts up and illuminates a screen behind the stage. The screen is fully black except for the center of the screen, where a white circle remains. 

The guests look in awe, confused as to if this is part of the event or not. 

Suddenly, the speakers blast with screams of terror. The guests cover their ears and begin to shake in fear. Some guests run to the exits and try to open the doors in an attempt to escape the horrors of the room. Chaos erupts in the feature gym. 

A voice screeches through the speakers 

Voice
This event is over!

Vikas XL looks around at the panic

Vikas XL
Thinking
And I didn’t even get to eat food…

Hitha turns to look at Negha. Hitha’s eyes enlarged. 

Negha eyes are wide, staring furiously at the white circle on the screen. She is chanting in whispers even faster than before. 

Hitha
Negha, are you ok?

Hitha shakes Negha, but she is unresponsive, entranced by the white circle on the screen. 

Rishika looks up at the stage, where the groom is trying to get the bride’s attention. However, the bride is staring at the circle and reciting the chant just like Negha. 

Negha begins chanting faster and faster

…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI….

Some guests are entranced in a blank state, just like Negha and the bride are. These guests go up on to the stage. They are all chanting under their breath on the stage. 

…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI…JAI….

Negha and the Bride join this group and they all form a circle. The group holds hands and begins moving their legs in and out, while turning their head left to right every few seconds, still chanting. 

Arun 
The Aztec ritual?

Suddenly, the speakers quiet down and the screams get fainter and fainter. 

A loud, distorted, robotic voice begins to speak through the speakers. 

Voice
“In darkness, power awakens. When the light goes out, the power of Jai will arise”

As the voice finishes its last words, the white circle slowly turns black. The entire screen is black. Then the projector stops projecting and the lights turn back on. Negha faints and falls into Hitha's hands. The bride also faints on stage. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting: Negha and Priya’s room. The event was cut short and the police are currently investigating. The group carried Negha to her room and Negha is currently sleeping. Aswin and Priya stand beside Negha. 

Aswin 
What a disaster of an event

Priya
I mean it was going well until..

Aswin 
Whatever happened was terrifying. Could this be related to Nidarshan. How is he doing this?

Priya
Aswin, Nidarshan is in jail. There’s no way 



Aswin 
Only he would want to ruin an SIA event. Could he have some ally carrying all this out? Who is Jai?

Priya
Maybe it’s the guy from Vijayadashami?

Aswin
Possibly, but he wasn’t even at this event

Aswin and Priya get deep into thought, trying to remember if there were any suspicious guests at the event. Priya eventually falls asleep on her bed, while Aswin is seated on a chair solving a rubix cube. 

The clock on the microwave turns to 1am. 

Suddenly, Negha’s phone buzzes twice. As Aswin starts to get up to go read the message, Negha bolts up from her bed. Aswin backs away in alarm. 

Aswin 
Negha! You’re awake!

Negha ignores Aswin and mechanically stands up from her bed. She walks out the door barefoot as Aswin continuously calls out after her. 

Aswin 
Negha, come back!

Negha does not even hear Aswin and is still in a blank, trance-like state as she walks out of Windsor into the pitch black night. 

Aswin 
At least put some shoes on!

Negha blankly wanders down 3rd street. Aswin follows her, making sure she is safe. 

Aswin 
Where are you going? Tsacoa is closed!

Aswin follows Negha past the bell tower, past Walc, and to the clapping circle. Aswin starts to maintain a distance as Negha approaches the clapping circle. There are  20 hooded individuals surrounding the clapping circle. They all have vibuthi on. Negha puts her hood on and joins their circle. They all do a clap together, producing the squeaking noise, and then walk in a single file line into the PMU.

The leader of the line taps their ID and the door unlocks. One by one, the group enters the PMU. Just as the last person walks in and the door is about to close, Aswin races to the door and holds it open. He slips inside, and puts on his hood. Aswin follows from a distance.

The line goes down the stairs and enters room B045. The room is full of construction equipment and is very creepy/eerie. The members of the line turn the line into a circle, just like before in the clapping circle. Aswin observed from outside the room.

The leader of the line clears their throat and begins speaking. The voice is vaguely familiar to Aswin, as if he has heard it often before.

Leader
I love!

Circle 
2good!

Leader
Who do we love?

Circle
2good!

Leader
When do we love him!

Circle
Everyday!

Leader
Who is he?

Circle
Jai…Jai….Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai..

Leader
Welcome friends. Today we are going to be speaking about the truth. And what is the truth you may say? The truth is the truth. The truth is everything. It is what we hold dear to our hearts…

Aswin 
Thinking 
Ugh…This is getting boring… Dumasses…

Aswin pulls out his phone and starts watching reels

Suddenly, after a few reels, the leader says something interesting.

Leader
…And that is why we are launching operation N

Aswin is alarmed 

Aswin
Thinking 
Operation N? Negha??

Aswin, in his state of alarm, accidentally turns his volume up all the way. The audio of the reel, superstar’s Hukum, starts playing at full volume.

Aswin 
Oh shoot!

The group slowly turns and looks out the door to see Aswin. Aswin freezes in his spot. Suddenly the leader starts running towards the door. As the leader runs, his hood comes undone off his head. Aswin is shocked when realizing who the leader of this cult is.

Aswin 
It can’t be…. Superstar???
