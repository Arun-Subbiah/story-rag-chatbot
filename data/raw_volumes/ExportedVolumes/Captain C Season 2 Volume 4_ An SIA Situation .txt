Captain C Season 2 Volume 4
Aswin, in his state of alarm, accidentally turns his volume up all the way. The audio of the reel, superstar’s Hukum, starts playing at full volume.

Aswin 
Oh shoot!

The group slowly turns and looks out the door at Aswin. Aswin freezes in his spot. Suddenly the leader starts running towards the door. As the leader runs, his hood comes undone off his head. Aswin is shocked when realizing who the leader of this cult is.

Aswin 
It can’t be… Superstar?!?!

Aswin begins to run away from the cult. He bolts up the stairs as Superstar Hisham bursts out the door and races to catch up to Aswin. Aswin, in his state of panic, trips on the last stair and falls to the ground. Hisham stands above him.

Hisham maniacally laughs- Chitti Laugh

Hisham 
So boy… you’ve fallen into our net 

Aswin eyes him with malice

Aswin jumps to his feet and throws a punch at Hisham. Hisham does a flip and as he comes to the ground, kicks Aswin to the ground. Aswin groans in pain.

 Hisham stands above Aswin, smiling down at him. Hisham twists his leather jacket back and forth before twisting his sunglasses and stylishly putting it on his face. 

Hisham 
Superstar-u Da!

Arun is sound asleep in bed. The time is past 2am. Suddenly, Arun jumps up in shock. He twists back and forth in his bed, as if he has been possessed. Arun flips back and forth across his bed before finally jolting up and coming to his senses. He is panting very heavily. 

Arun
Panting 
Aswin… Aswin… No!

Arun realizes that something bad has happened. Arun feels that Aswin is in danger through his senses. Arun races to his phone on his desk and opens up the group chat.

Arun 
Typing 
SIA: Red Alert! Guys, something is seriously wrong. I believe Aswin is in danger. 

Nobody has responded.

Arun
Thinking 
They must be all asleep 

Arun looks at the time on his phone. It is past 2am.

Arun
Thinking 
I’m in Lark right now. How possibly could I get to campus and search for Aswin? Oh maybe it’s just a random nightmare… 

Arun looks up and runs to the window. He desperately opens the blinds and stares at the moon, hoping his partner is safe.

Text: The Next Day

Setting: Negha and Priya’s room. 

It is 10am and Priya has just woken up. Priya glances across the room and notices that Negha is not there. 

Priya
Oh Negha, I hope she’s safe!

Just as Priya gets up from her bed and walks over to her brush, a buzzing sound is heard from Negha’s side of the room. Priya turns around and notices Negha's phone is on her table, and has just received a text message. 

The phone is next to Negha’s old Grande Iced White Mocha from a few days ago. 

Priya
Negha has got to throw that away…

Priya walks over to the phone and turns it on. The phone is locked and the message is not able to be read. However, the text is from a contact with the name ‘Konnuru.’ Konnuru has sent Negha texts every 10 minutes for the past 11 hours. The texts have been sent at exactly times ending with a zero. 

Priya
Konnuru… Who could that possibly be? Why does this name sound familiar?...

Suddenly, the door bursts open. Priya quickly turns to the door in surprise. 

Sanjana stands boldly through the doorframe. Priya begins to smile and say good morning to Sanjana, but she stops herself. Sanjana is angry. She stares down Priya in fury, her face as red as a bowl of Windsor tomato soup. 

Sanjana
Mockingly 
HellO PriYA!

Priya
Sanjana…What’s up…What’s wrong?

Sanjana
Are you kidding me? What’s wrong? You are what’s wrong!

Priya
Me? What did I do?...

Sanjana
Don’t try to play the fool with me, McNamara!

Priya
Seriously? I have no idea!



Sanjana 
How could you send me such mean messages on instagram! I thought we were friends! And that email that Negha sent Sai! That was so rude! We are DONE with you!

Sanjana whirls around and storms out the door. Priya runs out the door and watches Sanjana as Sanjana walks back to her room. Sai stands near the door, shaking her head. Priya watches Sai with tears in her eyes.

Text: Evening, West Lafayette. 

Arun is walking down third street to the corec, to relax by playing basketball after a very busy day of classes. As he walks by Cosi, he notices Negha and Aswin walking out of Windsor. Arun runs up to catch up with them. 

Arun
Hey Aswin! Hi Negha! What’s up

Aswin and Negha ignore Arun and walk past him to continue down third street, in the direction of the WALC.

Arun 
Where are you guys going?

Aswin and Negha continue to walk by without a word. 

Arun 
Thinking
I can’t believe it! Is Aswin under this Jai curse too?

Arun continues down 3rd street, across Krach lawn, and into the Corec. Compilation of Arun, Rohit, and Jai playing basketball. They play until 11pm. The boys are tired and they exit the gym and sit in the room across from the swimming pool with the massive jumbotron. 

Arun 
So, what’s the plan guys? Does anyone want to go to Cary?

Rohit 
I have some work to do. I got a new part time job.

Jai
Oh cool! What is it?

Rohit
I’m working to help develop a new AI model for this company

Arun
That’s awesome! Jai what about you?

Jai
I’m feeling kind of tired.. I’m probably gonna head back and hang out with Sugay

Arun 
Oh ok.. See you guys

Arun watches Jai and Rohit as they leave. 

Arun
Thinking
It’s always great playing basketball with the people you love.

Arun glances up at the big screen. A college basketball game is playing on the screen. Arun watches the game while lost in his thoughts. 

Arun 
Thinking
There is a massive threat in West Lafayette right now. People are disappearing and returning a day or two later. However, when they return, they are completely different. Like they are under some curse. And why do they keep saying ‘Jai’? 

Arun’s leaps out of his seat in a sudden jolt of realization 

Arun 
Thinking 
Could my Jai be the reason behind all this? But he’s just a normal guy. How could he possibly be related to all this weirdness?

Suddenly, the big screen begins staticking. The screens all flicker at once with a static noise emanating from the screen. Suddenly, three letters are displayed on the screen. 

J          A           I

Arun stares at the screen with his mouth open, unable to process what has just happened. Suddenly, his phone begins buzzing with texts. 

The group is filled with messages about how their laptops have displayed the same ‘JAI’ message. 

Sai Aiswarya
I can’t do my 350 homework now!

Aadit 
Me Neither! 

Suddenly, the screen starts flickering again for a few seconds before returning to the football game from before.


—————————————————————————————————————————-

Setting: West Lafayette, 12am. The PMU basement in room B045. The cult of Jai is in another midnight meeting. Hisham stands at the front of the stage. A group of 30 hooded individuals stand before him. The cult members all have Vibuthi on their foreheads. There are multiple TV screens surrounding the room, all with the text Jai filling the screens.

Hisham 
Welcome dear friends and followers of Jai…

Aswin and Negha are in the front row of the group of 30 followers.

Hisham 
A few hours ago, our message spread to computer screens all across the Purdue Campus with the help of a new friend. Our name is now known…

Group 
Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai….

Hisham 
We have finally expanded our army to a sufficient amount. We can now carry out our first attack in two days. Wednesday at 6pm, we are launching the attack on the belltower!

Group 
Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai….

Hisham 
And now with my new assistant commanders, Captain C and Boba Girl, we will be launching Operation N the following week on our fateful, holy day!

Aswin and Negha nod and salute Hisham.

Aswin and Negha
Anything for you, Superstar

Hisham puts his hand into a fist and raises it in the air.

Hisham 
I love 2good!

Crowd
I love 2good!

Crowd
Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai….

In the middle of the crowd, a boy is chanting along with the other inspired individuals. The camera moves over to the boy. A hood covers the boy’s curly hair. The boy is wearing a mask, concealing his identity. 

The boy walks up to the stage and bows in front of Hisham. 

Hisham 
Ah, my SIA spy! Without you none of this would have been possible

Hisham eyes Aswin and Negha as he says this

Hisham 
SIA board members on our side! The boss would have never expected this. And none of this would have been possible if you didn’t join the dance group. 

Hisham puts his hand on the mystery boy’s shoulder. 

Camera zooms out and fades to black as the chant continues
