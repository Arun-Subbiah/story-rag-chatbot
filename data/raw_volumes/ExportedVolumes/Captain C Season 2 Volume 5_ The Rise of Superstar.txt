Setting: March 9th. 11:55 pm. 

A hooded Hisham stands alongside the Wabash river. He looks and sees the bright, large moon above the bridge. The moon’s bright reflection illuminates the river. It is the day of the super moon. Hisham admires the moon. The moon was as beautiful as his own instagram posts.

Hisham opens up his backpack and reveals a collection of red/brownish colored rocks. He takes out one of the rocks and brings it to the river. He kneels and cleans the rock, washing it off of all its dust. 

Hisham takes out his phone. 11:59 pm. 

Hisham
It’s almost time 

Hisham places the rock in the air, directly under the glow of the moon. The moon’s bright reflection falls upon the rock. The rock begins to tremble in Hisham’s hands. 

Hisham reads the time on his phone. 12 am. 

The rock floats up in the air and begins spinning. As the rock spins, it slowly begins to rid itself of its red color and becomes pure white. The color of the moon. After multiple rotations midair, the rock floats back down to Hisham’s hand. 

Hisham smiles maniacally. 

Hisham 
It is time.

Hisham points in the direction past the bridge and into Lafayette. 

Hisham 
Anything for my lord!

Hisham takes out a hammer from his bag. He wields the hammer in the air. 

Just as he is about to swing the hammer down and smash the rock, cut to:

Setting: Sunset. The bridge over the Wabash river. 

Arun stands on the bridge, observing the sun setting over the river. 

Arun 
Thinking 
The sun sets over the river. But peace has never set over this city. 

Arun looks up at the sky in angst. 

Arun 
Thinking 
Over the past two days, Negha and Aswin have still been acting extremely strangely. It is like they are under some curse, or they have been controlled by something. 

A bird flies above Arun’s head. Arun looks up and stares at the bird

Arun 
Thinking 
If only Aswin and Negha could fly as free as that bird. 

Arun walks along the bridge, his head down in disappointment as he walks back towards campus. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to Hitha holding office hours at Lawson. She is packing her stuff up and is getting ready to leave. Suddenly, the door swings open. Aadit and Rishika walk in.

Hitha turns around and smiles.

Hitha
Hi Aadit. Hi Rishika.

Hitha’s smile slowly turns into a frown of concern. Rishika and Aadit are staring at Hitha with anger.

Rishika
Hitha, what is wrong with you?

Aadit 
How could you do this to us?


Hitha
What? What did I do?

Rishika
This is the worst thing someone’s done to me in my life!

Aadit 
How did you have the guts to defame us on the SIA story!

Hitha
The SIA story? I don’t even manage social media?

Rishika
Then why did the story have “from Hitha” on it?

Hitha
That’s ridiculous.. I’ve been busy all day!

Rishika pulls out her phone and points it at Hitha. Hitha glances at the screen and her jaw drops. The screen reveals a picture of Rishika. The text reads: “Rishika is the worst.” Rishika taps the screen once to move on to the next story. It is a picture of Aadit. The text reads: “Aadit is even worse.” Rishika taps the screen again. “From Hitha.”

Hitha
Bro I did not do this!

Rishika and Aadit shake their heads and start walking out the room. 

Rishika
You are no longer our friend

Aadit 
Goodbye. 

Camera zooms in on a tear forming in Hitha’s eyes. As her tear drops on to the floor, transition to a raindrop falling outside of Windsor. Camera cuts to Priya’s room. 

Priya is watching the rain through her window, her arms wrapped around her knees. Her face is incredibly dull. She turns around and looks at Negha’s side of the room. Negha is still gone. 

Camera cuts to Sanjana and Sai Aiswarya’s dorm a few doors down. Sanjana lies on her upper bunk bed with her eyes open, staring at the ceiling. Sai Aiswarya is hysterically crying on the floor, and her tears have formed a river connecting the two sides of the room.

Sai Aiswarya
I am so Traumatized!

Camera cuts to Arun sitting at a table at the Corec. He is writing into a notebook, trying to connect the clues and figure out the truth behind this mysterious cult, and how to cure Aswin and Negha. He puts his head in his hands in frustration. 

The entire group is broken and separated. Is this the end of their friendship? Will we see anymore of the SIA guardians? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to Outside of the PMU. The time is 12:05am. 

Cut to PMU room B045. The cult meeting has just started. Hisham stands at the front of the stage. A group of around 30 hooded individuals stand before him. 

Hisham 
Good morning fellow Jais!

Group 
Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai….

Hisham 
Today, Wednesday at 6, we are attacking the belltower! We will be making a name for ourselves, before we execute our ultimate goal on Monday, the holy day! In today’s meeting, we will be discussing the planning for tomorrow's Attack. From tomorrow onwards, we will meet to plan our ultimate purpose. 

Group 
Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai….

Hisham 
And to help us with this purpose, we have some more recruits, thanks to our SIA spy!

Suddenly, a boy walks into the room with bags across his shoulders. There are people in these bags. These bags are incredibly heavy, and it is remarkable that the boy is carrying all these bags at once. He is extremely strong. The boy is the same boy from yesterday, with curly hair. His identity is still hidden. The boy kneels in respect before the Superstar. 

Hisham
Ah, fresh meat! Open these bags up!

The boys open the bags and 5 college students come crawling out. 

Student #1
I need to go back, my shell project is due on Monday!

Student #2
Same, Please let us go!

Hisham
QUIET!

Hisham’s voice is incredibly loud and imposing. He is a true leader. The students shake in fear, startled by Hisham’s magnificent presence. Hisham winks at the students. 

Camera focuses on Aswin, Negha, and the Bride in the crowd, entranced by the events happening on the stage. 

Negha 
Go Hisham!

Aswin and the Bride
We love you Superstar!

Hisham nods at them and then takes out the sunglasses from his pocket. He puts them on superstar style. Aswin claps. 

Hisham pulls out a box from the back pocket of his leather pants. He adjusts his leather jacket before finally opening up the box. As the camera zooms in to reveal a white, powdery substance in the box, the camera cuts away. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cut to Negha walking by herself down 3rd street. The meeting is over. Time: 1:30am. She walks up the Windsor halls and reaches her room. As she swings her door open, Sai Aiswarya stands before her, with tears in her eyes. Priya is not in the room. 

Negha does not notice her and walks to her bed. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha!

Negha sits down on her bed and stares at the wall on the other side. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha! Listen to me!

Sai Aiswarya walks in front of Negha and waves her hands to get Negha’s attention. Negha is still oblivious to Saiswarya’s efforts. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha, look at me! Hello?!?

Sai Aiswarya does the entirety of the DJ Tillu dance. Negha is still unfazed, continuing to stare at the wall. 

Sai Aiswarya
Oh, what is wrong with you.. I just want the old Negha back…

Tears form in Sai Aiswarya’s eyes. Camera zooms in on her eyes as a tear falls in slow motion. The tear falls through the air and lands in Negha’s old Grande Iced White Mocha. The tear turns gold in the mocha. Suddenly, golden swirls appear across the drink and sparks fly within the cup. Then, the cup goes back to normal. Sai Aiswarya and Negha are oblivious to the magic occurring within the cup. 

Sai Aiswarya 
Negha, this is the last straw! No more joking around! Listen to me!

Sai Aiswarya gently grabs Negha’s chin and shakes it back and forth. Negha suddenly snaps her head to the right and stares deep into Sai Aiswarya’s eyes. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha?

Suddenly, Negha pounces from her bed and attacks Sai Aiswarya. Sai Aiswarya screams in terror. Negha uses her nails to scratch Sai Aiswarya’s face. Sai Aiswarya kicks her feet in distress, knocking the grande iced white mocha in the air. The drink’s lid pops open, and the drink falls all over Negha’s head. 

Cut to End credits.
