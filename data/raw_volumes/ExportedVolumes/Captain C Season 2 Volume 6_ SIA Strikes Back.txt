Sai Aiswarya 
Negha, this is the last straw! No more joking around! Listen to me!

Sai Aiswarya gently grabs Negha’s chin and shakes it back and forth. Negha suddenly snaps her head to the right and stares deep into Sai Aiswarya’s eyes. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha?

Suddenly, Negha pounces from her bed and attacks Sai Aiswarya. Sai Aiswarya screams in terror. Negha uses her nails to scratch Sai Aiswarya’s face. Sai Aiswarya kicks her feet in distress, knocking the grande iced white mocha in the air. The drink’s lid pops open, and the drink falls all over Negha’s head. 

Negha stops attacking Sai Aiswarya and freezes. Suddenly, her feet lift off the ground and she begins floating in the air for a few seconds. Then, Negha drops to the floor with a thud.

Sai Aiswarya
Negha! Are you okay! What just happened oh no oh no!

Negha slowly regains consciousness and notices Sai Aiswarya in front of her. 

Sai Aiswarya
Negha? Are you normal again?

Negha
What.. where am I… what just happened?

Sai Aiswarya
It’s ok! It’s all okay I’m with you! What.. What do you remember last?

Negha
I remember going to throw trash behind the AAARCC… and then suddenly a bunch of hooded thugs came and kidnapped me! 

Sai Aiswarya
What?? Who??

Negha
I don’t know.. they were all hooded and masked…but they all had vibuthi on?

Sai Aiswarya
Are you traumatized?

Negha
I think so… Are we all set for the mock Kalyanam tomorrow?

Sai Aiswarya
Tomorrow? Negha, it’s Tuesday night! The mock Kalyanam was on Sunday. Do you not remember anything that happened in the last few days? 

Negha
What? I don’t remember anything!

Sai Aiswarya
Interesting… so that mean message wasn’t from you?

Negha shakes her head

Negha
Wait if it’s tuesday, then I have to send the message for the dance dinner on Friday! And I have to get boba tomorrow to celebrate mango boba Wednesday!

Sai Aiswarya
Looking into the Camera
She’s back to normal now

Sai Aiswarya and Negha are hugging, as Sai Aiswarya comforts Negha. Suddenly, the door swings open. An entranced Aswin walks through the door and sits on the bed. Negha and Sai Aiswarya stare at him.

Negha
Aswin?

Aswin is unresponsive. At the same time, Sai Aiswarya and Negha turn and look at the half spilled mocha drink. Negha grabs the remainder of the drink in the cup and splashes it at Aswin. 

Suddenly, Aswin lifts off the ground and begins floating in the air for a few seconds. Then, Aswin drops to the floor with a thud.

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Sai Aiswarya 
So none of you guys remember anything that happened the last few days? 

Aswin and Negha shake their heads. The group sits in silence for a while, trying to figure out some next steps. 

Aswin 
I have some flashes of some things that happened. I remember seeing a familiar face lead the cult. I think the meeting was near the PMU or something?

Negha
My memories are extremely vague as well. I think they were talking about some kind of attack? At the bell tower?

Aswin 
Wait, I remember! Attack on the bell tower at 6pm today!

Negha
Oh my boba! We have to tell the group! We have to stop them!

Sai Aiswarya
About that… 

Aswin 
What’s wrong?

Sai Aiswarya 
The group is currently split up. Everyone hates each other. They’ve all been sending mean messages to each other!

Negha
Mean messages? I mean I was possessed so maybe I could have sent something? But nobody else was under the curse! Who could’ve sent these messages?

Sai Aiswarya
I don’t know… 

Aswin 
For now call up Arun. We’ll fight these guys off now and figure out the group situation later…

Morning: Hisham’s apartment. Hisham sits at his couch with his legs crossed, sunglasses on. 

A hooded boy walks through the door. His curly hair seeps below his hood. He is carrying a bag with a person inside. 

Hisham 
Ah, welcome in my SIA spy 

The boy throws the bag in the middle of the room. He slowly pulls down his hood, revealing his face. 

The daring face of Anurag Koripalli is revealed. 

Anurag
I have one more for you, Superstar.

Hisham 
Another addition to the army!

Hisham pulls out a box from his pocket and stands over the bag. The boy in the bag is struggling, trying to get out of the bag. Anurag opens the bag and a boy comes crawling out. 

Anurag 
Another one from the dance group.

The boy crawls to the feet of Hisham and clutches it, begging to let him go. Hisham looks down at the boy. Sahil glances up with tears in his eyes. Hisham smiles down at him with malice. Hisham kicks Sahil with all his might. Sahil flies and hits a lightbulb attached to the ceiling. He screams in pain. 

Hisham opens the box to reveal white powder inside. 

Hisham 
Ancient Vibuthi… Oh I am just so excited to take on this role from my boss and accomplish his dreams. Anything for my lord. 

Hisham thinks back to that day, a few months back.

Date: January 16th. Camera focuses on a crow flying above the Purdue campus. The bird flies across the bell tower and approaches Hawkins dorm. As the bird moves past the 11th floor of Hawkins, the camera moves away from the bird and moves into a dorm on the 11th floor.  A man in a suit is sitting at his chair in front of his desk. He slowly turns around, revealing his slight sly smile. 

Nidarshan smiles at a boy in a leather jacket sitting across from him. The camera moves around to reveal the man in the leather jacket. 

Hisham 
Boss, I am so honored to learn from you. 

Nidarshan 
Hisham, you truly are a superstar. 

Hisham 
What’s my role? Can I help with project C?

Nidarshan 
Hisham, I am going to train you to become my second in command. However, for now, you must remain a sleeper cell. 

Hisham 
What do you mean? 

Nidarshan 
In case Project C goes wrong, you will take over all my duties. And in order to do that, you will launch Operation N at that time. 

Hisham 
What is that?

Nidarshan 
There are two phases for Operation N. Today, I will explain the first phase.

Hisham nods

Nidarshan 
On the first attempt of Project C, I talked to some Chettiar elders when I went back in time. They explained the ancient red rock that makes up the Thirumayam Fort and the Perumal temple near it. During the supermoon, this rock is activated and turns pure white. Grinding this into a vibuthi and applying it on a victim has…

Hisham adjusts his leather jacket in awe. 


Nidarshan 
Hypnotic powers…

Hisham 
Wow! Unreal! This is as fascinating as a horned bull!

Nidarshan 
And it doesn’t stop there… 

Hisham 
What…What..What is it???

Nidarshan 
On the day the moon covers the sun…

Hisham is dancing with eagerness

Nidarshan 
This has destructive powers!

Hisham throws his sunglasses in the air

Hisham and Nidarshan then maniacally laugh in unison. 

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Hisham stares at Sahil. Sahil backs away in fear. 

Sahil 
Please let me go! I’ve done nothing wrong!

Hisham and Anurag laugh at Sahil 

Hisham
Fool!

Hisham applies the Vibuthi to Sahil’s forehead. Sahil starts twitching in pain and then starts rolling all over the floor. Then, suddenly with a snap, he stops. The camera zooms in to focus on Hisham’s smile. Hisham stylishly adjusts his leather jacket before throwing his glasses stylishly on his face. 

Hisham 
Superstar-u Da!

Setting: Wednesday, 5:30 pm. Arun, Aswin, Negha, and Sai Aiswarya are sitting at the AAARCC basement, SIA-Captain C headquarters. 

Aswin 
It’s almost time for the cult to launch the attack on the belltower. 

Sai Aiswarya
We have to get going!

Negha
Do we have time for a boba break before we fight?

The gang leaves the AAARCC and reaches the bell tower. They see a group of 33 hooded individuals standing at the base of the bell tower. Three of these individuals are standing at the front of the group. 

Hisham pulls off his hood to reveal his face. He is at the front of the cult. The boys on the left and right of Hisham take off their hoods and masks. Sahil and Anurag stand on each side of Hisham. 

Hisham 
Bring it on!

Aswin looks at Sai Aiswarya and Negha on one side, and then at Arun on the other side. Arun and Aswin nod.

Aswin 
It’s chettiar time!
