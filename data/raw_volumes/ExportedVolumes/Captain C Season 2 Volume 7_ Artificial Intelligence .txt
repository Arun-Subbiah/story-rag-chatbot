Setting: 6pm, at the bell tower. Arun, Aswin, Sai Aiswarya, and Negha see a group of 33 hooded individuals standing at the base of the bell tower. Three of these individuals are standing at the front of the group. 

Hisham pulls off his hood to reveal his face. He is at the front of the cult. The boys on the left and right of Hisham take off their hoods and masks. Sahil and Anurag stand on each side of Hisham. 

Hisham 
Bring it on!

Aswin looks at Sai Aiswarya and Negha on one side, and then at Arun on the other side. Arun and Aswin nod.

Aswin 
It’s chettiar time!

Aswin and Arun race towards the terrifying cult with the rage to hurt. The cultists race forward in front of Hisham, Anurag, and Sahil. Arun and Aswin attempt to attack them, but are instantly swarmed and knocked to the ground.

Sai Aiswarya and Negha attempt to fight off a few of these enemies, but they too are overwhelmed by the sheer size of the army.

Arun 
There’s too many of them!

Sai Aiswarya 
We need more of us!

Negha comes face to face with the bride. The bride does multiple flips in the air and lands by kicking Negha to the ground. Sai Aiswarya is attacked by a few enemies and falls.

Hisham slaps Aswin and Aswin flips to the ground. Arun is restrained by a group of 10 enemies. 

Arun, Aswin, Negha, and Sai watch as Hisham, Sahil, and Anurag set up a rig of explosives around the bell tower. They start running away, followed by their cult. As they run, they yell their chant 

Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai…Jai…


Aswin 
We have to get out of here!

Arun, Aswin, Sai Aiswarya, and Negha crawl out of the range of the bell tower, as an explosion is heard and the bell tower comes crashing down.

Setting: Forest in some unknown location. It is the next night. Hisham and his cultists are setting up tents in the middle of the forest.

Hisham sits inside of his tent with his sunglasses on, meditating. Sahil and Anurag knock, and then enter the tent.

Hisham 
Welcome, dumplings

Anurag 
Sir, are we sure this is a safe place

Hisham 
Yes. We are within 100% visibility of the eclipse, meaning our ancient chettinad rock will activate completely 

Sahil 
Activate completely? What is going to happen 

Hisham adjusts his leather jacket, stylishly.

Hisham 
In the few minutes that the sun is completely covered by the moon, the rock will change properties. We will put the transformed rock into the super weapon, and use the weapon to pursue our ultimate goal. 

Anurag 
What’s the super weapon?

Hisham glances to the side of the tent, eyeing a big box. He carries the heavy box with minimal effort, and places it in front of Anurag and Sahil. He opens the box to reveal a massive weapon with a huge funnel in the center. A button lies to the side. On the end of the weapon is a massive hole.

Hisham 
This is the weapon. The ChettiarBlaster! In the funnel, we will put in our transformed chettiar rock. And then when we press the button, through the hole, a massive blast of energy, power, and destructiveness will be fired!

Sahil 
That’s Tu!

Hisham 
And we will use this weapon to complete the purpose of this cult 

Anurag smiles maliciously 

Hisham 
Whispers
And complete Operation N…

Hisham, Anurag, and Sahil stand around the weapon in a circle. They interlock hands and begin moving their legs inwards and outwards, while oscillating their heads between left and right every few seconds. A display of the Aztec Ritual.

The group of three increases the speed of the Aztec Ritual. Suddenly, the weapon begins slowly floating in the air. The camera zooms from the weapon to the plotting smile on Hisham’s face.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting: AAARRCC- Captain C/SIA headquarters. Aswin, Arun, Sai Aiswarya, and Negha are sitting around a table, with laptops out in front of them 

Aswin 
Whoever this Jai is can just go piss off!

Arun 
We have to go step by step and connect all the dots. How did all of this start? We have to find some clue. 

Negha
Me and Aswin got kidnapped. We were a part of the cult. The cult attacked the bell tower in their first plan. And I believe they have some other bigger goal? 

Aswin 
And it seems like the only cure to the curse is a rotten coffee drink? And why were they all wearing vibuthi?

Sai Aiswarya
I believe at some point, Priya said that Negha was receiving messages from someone that made her wake up and go to the night meetings. 

Negha goes through her phone and checks her messages. 

Negha 
Here it is! Messages from a contact named “Maybe: Konnuru”

Arun 
Konnuru? That’s my friend's last name! How did I not know about this? It can’t be him…

Sai Aiswarya
I mean, we are all separated right now.. nobody meets anymore.

The group of four hang their heads in silence. Negha goes through the messages. 

Negha
They all say “meeting in 15min”. No other messages other than these. 

Aswin 
Darn!

Negha
Wait, one of these messages has been edited. 

Sai Aiswarya
On IMessage, you can see what it has been edited from 

Negha
The current message is “meeting in 15min.” And the previous one is…

Negha’s eyes expand in dread. She glances up at the group in fear.

Arun 
What?

Negha
“Meeting in 15min, This model was developed by Rohit Kannan.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting: Hillenbrand dorm on the 3rd floor. Arun swings open the door and meets Rohit sitting at his desk playing a video game.

Arun 
I need Answers!

Rohit
What?

Arun 
What AI project are you working on?! Who is it under? 

Rohit
The project was originally started by a Purdue Computer Science student under a research grant. 

Arun
Who?

Rohit
Hmm… my boss didn’t say. But it’s currently being managed by this other guy from SIA, the boss. 

Arun 
And that is…

Rohit
Hisham… the superstar 

Arun’s jaw drops in disbelief.

Arun 
Are you aware of the scale of danger you are being involved with?

Rohit
No… what do you mean? I thought this was a research experiment 

Arun 
Explain your work.




Rohit
I saw this job opening to help create an AI model that can recursively improve its knowledge and eventually reach a final stage: superintelligence. The boss Hisham is in charge of what the AI is used for, I’m not aware what he does. 

Arun 
What are some of the features you’ve helped build?

Rohit 
I don’t know… I trained the model to learn common passwords among Indian students at Purdue. I made a mean text generator LLM. I made an event planning text generator. Other things too…

Arun 
And what did you name this model?

Rohit
Funny story. Hisham said I could name it whatever I want. I named it Jai, after our friend Jai Konnuru. Hisham said he needed a name for a new club he was making. He liked the slang we use. Superstar said the club will adopt it. What a fun guy. 

Arun 
Bruh, Hisham is a criminal mastermind. Immediately stop working on this, he is using our language to control innocents and create a cult of slaves that he will use to ruin the peace in Purdue. He already caused the collapse of the bell tower…

Rohit
That was him?? My bad bruh 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting: Friday Night, Taste of India. The “dance group” enters the building. 

Arun 
Where’s Aswin and Negha? 

Hitha
They’re searching for the ring that Negha lost on memorial mall 

Arun 
And Saiswarya?

Rishika
She’s working on 350 homework.

Arun 
Whatever, they already know the story. I have to explain to you guys the problem at hand. 

Arun explains to the group that a super intelligent AI has gained autonomy. The AI named Jai is working on its own to hack into social media accounts and send mean messages. Arun explains how the AI is becoming more advanced day by day, and eventually it could get past university systems on a larger scale. He explains that the day all screens in Purdue displayed the message, “JAI”, was the first step of this goal. The AI is working as an agent to organize and maximize Hisham’s success in his cult operations, by running multiple models and extracting the best possible outcomes. 

Arun 
Thankfully, the AI isn’t fully autonomous and is open to human intervention. Rohit has given me access. We can learn about Hisham’s plans through communication with the model, and after that we can shut down the AI.

Hitha 
Wow, that is a lot of danger at the hands of Artificial Intelligence.

Arun 
Yeah, right? I should probably take a class on data science ethics in the future to learn and protect myself from the dangers of AI 

Suddenly, Aswin and Negha walk in. The group all stares at each other for a moment. Then, everyone runs together to meet in a group hug.

Priya
I missed you guys! 

Hitha hugs Rishika and Aadit.

Aadit
We are all stronger together

Aswin looks into the camera. 

Aswin 
No matter how tough it gets, we must always be there for each other and have each other's backs. That is the true quality of friendship. 

Cut to the group happily eating dinner. Hitha goes up to the bearded server in black, and says something.

As Arun is about to take his next bite, he freezes. Maamadura has started to play. Arun winks into the camera. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjana walks from the bathroom back to the table in her yellow and black checked shirt. As she enters back in the room, she looks up to see the entire group dancing to Maamadura in the middle of Taste of India! Sai Aiswarya enters through the door at the same moment. They both join in. The entire group happily dances to the remainder of the song, the calm before the storm that will strike upon them next.
