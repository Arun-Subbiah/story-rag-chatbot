A Chettiar Christmas



It’s Christmas Eve, and Santa is soaring in his sleigh across the snowy West Lafayette Campus. 

Santa Claus
Ahoy! This adventure is just too good!

Santa’s sleigh gracefully lands on top of Hawkins Hall, as he instructs his reindeer to come to a stop. 

Santa Claus
I’ve covered almost all of campus. Now I just have to deliver gifts for this one last friend group. 

Santa squints his eyes at the list 

Santa Claus
SIA? All on the nice list. Excellent.

Santa Claus reaches into his big bag and searches for the bag containing the SIA gifts. 

Santa Claus
Must be at the bottom!

Santa Claus searches the entire bag, but the SIA gifts are just not there.

Missing.

Santa takes out his candy cane phone from his belt. Santa dials the number of his operations manager and security chief, Subramani, and presses call.

Subramani
Yellow?

Santa Claus
Subramaniam! We have a case of missing gifts. 

Subramani 
Missing gifts? This has never happened before, ever! 

Santa Clause
That’s why I expect some foul play. Crime is rampant in this college town. I need help. 

Subramani 
How can I help you, chief.

Santa Clause
Connect me with the nearest superhero based on my current location. Whoever that is can help me recover the gifts

Subramani 
Got it, chief.

Subramani scours his database to locate the closest superhero to the West Lafayette-Lafayette region. To speed up the process, he runs an optimized SQL query, filtering by proximity, activity level, and recent mission logs. Only one name is returned by the query.

Subramani 
There’s one superhero, just one

Santa Claus
The name?

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subramani
Captain C is just a few blocks away, patrolling near Tapawingo Park. 

Santa adjusts his glasses, nodding.

Santa
Good. Patch me through to him, Subramani. We’ve got no time to waste. Without those gifts, Christmas for the SIA friends will be ruined!

Subramani activates a direct call to Captain C’s chettiar communicator

Aswin
This is Captain C. What’s the situation?

Santa Claus
Captain C? This is Santa Claus 

Aswin 
Santa Claus? Sir, I’m a big fan

Santa Claus
Likewise, I’m a huge fan of the Chettiars as well. Horrible what happened in the tragedy of 2001. 

Aswin 
What’s the matter, sir

Santa Claus
We’ve got a Christmas Crisis, Captain. A bag of presents has gone missing on your turf. Without it, Christmas is at stake for some students. Are you in?

Aswin
Saving Christmas? Sounds like a job worth doing. Send me the details, and I’ll get on it

Santa Claus
Details incoming. Subramani, guide him. I’ll continue on with the rest of the presents 

Subramani
Roger that, Santa. Let’s save Christmas

Captain C springs into action by jumping off the swing and getting into the driver’s seat of the chettiar-mobile. He waits for the car to heat up before driving, to ensure the engine oil circulates properly. Then, he backs out the car and drives it up the hill.

Aswin 
Where was Santa last before he noticed the gifts were missing?

Subramani 
According to my Life360 radar, he was last at Windsor residence hall

Aswin 
To Windsor I go 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain C arrives at Windsor Residence Hall and waits until a random arrives and scans in. He begins his search floor by floor. He checks each corner, scanning for clues with the precision of a seasoned investigator.  
Subramani 
On the database, it says you work with the SIA guardians. SIA’s gifts are the gifts that are missing

Aswin
Yes, those are my friends! They’ve all gone back home for winter break. I've stayed back to protect this city. 

Subramani 
I guess Santa wanted to drop off the presents on campus and the kids would have a welcome back surprise when they come back after break 
Finally, Aswin reaches the third floor, the floor where Sai, Sanjana, Negha, and Priya lived last year. He walks down the hallway.
Suddenly, his Chettiar senses start ringing—a deep, instinctive feeling that something unusual is wrong. It feels as though a chipmunk is poking his brain, warning him of danger. Captain C pauses, his eyes narrowing as he studies the door he has just crossed by.
The name on the door reads Jiapei.
Aswin 
This name was there last year as well. Subramani, enter a query for the name Jiapei, location Windsor

Subramani 
On it, Captain 

Aswin places his finger on the name, covering the ‘iap’ in ‘Jiapei.’ The name now reads: 

Jei*

Aswin 
Interesting 

Aswin takes out a special key manufactured by Aadit. This key mechanically shapeshifts and then can open any door. Aswin opens the door and is met by an extremely messy dorm room with nobody inside. Aswin walks inside, inspecting the room.

Aswin 
Still not as messy as Negha’s room. Subramani, any update?

Subramani 
I’m trying. The name Jiapei isn’t on either list, Naughty or Nice.

Aswin 
Interesting. 

Aswin walks to the desk on the right side of the room. Many papers and files are messily spread across the table. Aswin leans closer to inspect the papers.

Aswin 
That’s odd.

All the papers are filled with text. However, all of the text is just multiple assortments of ones and zeroes. There are hundreds of pages of paper on the table, all with just ones and zeroes inscribed upon them. 

Aswin 
Subramani, what could be the meaning of this? All just ones and zeroes?

Subramani 
Could be in binary, Captain. Scan them in and I can decipher it for you.


Aswin 
How do you know binary?

Subramani
Captain, I have a degree in Computer Science from North Pole State University.

Aswin scans the papers using his phone’s cam scanner and sends them over to Subramani. Subramani works to decipher the binary text using ASCII, forming letters and then words from the binary numbers. Aswin, in the meantime, watches reels. 

Subramani 
Captain, you’re not going to like this.

Aswin
What is it?

Subramani 
These are pages and pages of notes on Sanjana, Priya, Negha, and Sai dating back to last semester. About when they leave, what they’ve said, etc. This Jiapei has been spying on them all of last semester. 

Aswin 
Unreal.

Subramani
The very top page is the most recent print. It details a task: Ruin SIA’s Christmas by stealing their presents 

Aswin 
So we have our culprit.

Suddenly, the door swings open. An Asian teen with glasses stands at the door, her hair cut short. She carries a bag over her shoulder, labeled SIA presents. 

Aswin 
You thief!

Jiapei does not react to Aswin and her face is expressionless. Her eyes then focus on Aswin. Her face is moving mechanically as she scans him.

Aswin launches forward to deliver a punch to Jiapei’s neck. Aswin’s fist is met with a metal clank. Aswin clutches his hand, dancing in pain.

Aswin 
You’re not even a person… you’re a…a…robot?
She kicks him in the chest, knocking him back, then sweeps his legs out from under him. Aswin crashes to the floor, struggling to get up.
Jiapei stands over Aswin, ready to strike and finish him off. 
Suddenly, Subramani’s voice crackles through Aswin’s earpiece.
Subramani  
I’ve got control, hold on!

Jiapei freezes, her movements mechanically slowing before she collapses, powered off.
Aswin groans, getting to his feet.
Aswin  
Thanks Subramani, you saved me!

Subramani
No problem, Captain. It looks like this robot was used as a spy by someone under the name of, Nidarshan?

Aswin
His evil never stops its roar 

Subramani 
Looks like there’s a red chip installed. We can repurpose this robot for SIA purposes by installing our very own blue chip**

Aswin 
Sounds good Subramani. Thanks for the help. 

Subramani 
It’s my honor to serve a chettiar

Aswin 
For your help today, I would like to make you an honorary chettiar, granting you the title of Lieutenant Subramani

Subramani 
Thank you Captain C. It is every young boy’s dream to be affiliated with the Chettiar region 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aswin drives back to his apartment. As he enters his room with the bag of SIA gifts over his shoulder, he is met by the warm greetings of Santa Claus.

Santa Claus 
Ho..Ho..Ho…

Aswin
We saved Christmas!

Santa shakes Aswin’s hand

Santa Claus
And I see you’ve got all your friends’ gifts 

Aswin 
Yes! What exactly did you get all of them?

Santa Claus
Well let’s look at my list… for this Negha girl I got a boba maker 3000. Hope I’m saying it right. For Sai Aiswarya? Two first names? I’m going to call her Saiswarya. For Saiswarya I’ve got a new marudhani cone. For Aadit I got a new skateboard. For Priya I got a new sword. Oh, and for you I got a new iPhone 15!

Aswin 
Oh, I actually have one I got a year ago that’s still unopened. Thanks though.

Santa frowns 

Aswin 
You must be hungry, I’m not sure if I have milk and cookies 

Santa Claus
Wait, do you have biryani?

So Aswin and Santa eat the remaining half of Aswin’s leftover Vijaywada Chicken biryani while watching love island, with the text underneath reading: A Very Chettiar Christmas.

THE END
