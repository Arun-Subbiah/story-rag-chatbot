Aswin stands on the bridge that stands above the Wabash River, dividing West Lafayette and Lafayette. He leans on the railing, admiring the river that flows as gentle as a falling feather.
Aswin Voice Over
I am a Chettiar. One of the last Chettiars alive. We are a family. And with a family comes traditions.

There existed a council of Chettiars. The chettiar council consisted of the most powerful and wise Chettiars, ruling over the clan. The council guarded the ancient Chettiar rock, protecting it from getting in the wrong hands. They were the masters of fight and they were extremely skilled in the Chettiar arts. All the villages were ruled by this council. When a member of the council passes away, the next strongest and wisest Chettiar is elected in the council by all the villages. The last council all died in the tragedy of 2001. 

Hundreds of years ago, one of the first Chettiar councils had traveled to Burma, to accompany the Chettiar diaspora in Burma in a war against a tribal group of rebels. The Chettiars won the war, eliminating the rebels and restoring peace in the Burma land.

As the Chettiar Council was traveling back across the sea, a storm attacked. The council was in grave danger, trapped in the middle of a dangerous natural disaster.

Stranded at Sea.

Each of the days they were stranded at sea, they prayed to lord Ganesha, begging for a safe journey back home. When they prayed, they plucked out a string from their veshtis and placed it near the Pilayar statue. The council did this to keep track of the days lost at sea. 

After 21 days, a mysterious phenomenon occurred that helped navigate the council back to the Chettiar Region. Till this day, nobody knows what exactly happened. Many assume the power of Pilayar helped bring the Chettiars back home safely.

After realizing how powerful praying to Pilayar was, the Chettiars established a yearly holiday: Pilayar Nombu.

On a day in January, all Chettiars make a small sweet and inside insert 21 veshti strings, for each of the days the council was stranded at sea. They light the strings on fire and quickly eat the sweet while praying to Pilayar. 

This is the story of Pilayar Nombu.

Aswin closes his eyes.

Aswin walks up the stairs of Windsor with Negha and Priya, on the way to the room. They walk past Jiapei’s room.

Aswin 
I booked the rental car for our journey on Monday. A ten seater

Priya
Awesome!

Negha
Bobatastic!

The trio enters the room and sits on the bed. Aswin pulls out his laptop.

Aswin 
Arun got access to the AI from Rohit. He just sent the access code to me.

Priya
Let’s log in.

Aswin logs in on his laptop, and begins the chat with KonnuruGPT.

Konnuru 
What can I help you with?

Aswin 
What is Hisham’s plan on the day of the Eclipse

Konnuru 
The eclipse will activate the ancient chettiar rock, giving it destructive properties. We plan to use the power of this rock to create a super weapon, the Chettiar blaster. 

Aswin 
What’s the Chettiar blaster?

Konnuru
It's an extremely destructive super weapon. It has the potential to destroy from small buildings to entire cities

Aswin, Negha, and Priya’s jaws drop in disbelief. They are unable to believe the extent of the harm Hisham and his cult intend to cause.

Negha
Unreal… this weapon has the potential to cause our very own extinction 

Priya
Konnuru, what is their ultimate goal?

Konnuru 
First they will use the blaster to rescue Nidarshan from jail, and then-

Aswin, Priya, and Negha shriek in terror

Nidarshan???

Konnuru
Then they plan to use the weapon to destroy entire cities and slowly establish control across the country. The ultimate goal of Nidarshan is to reduce population and declare control over the world. He’s an extremist.

Aswin, Priya, and Negha fall to the ground, sunken by the weight of the responsibility on their shoulders. 

Aswin 
This is unbelievable!

Priya
The literal fate of the world is in our hands

Aswin 
If Nidarshan wins, so much will be destroyed. 

Negha
The cookie of peace will be broken down to crumbs. 

Aswin 
Konnuru, where is Hisham and his cult?

Konnuru
They are currently setting up camp in Lagoda, Indiana, where there is 100% visibility of the eclipse. Only under 100% visibility will the chettiar rock activate to its purest form.

Aswin 
We are going to Lagoda everyone. In the ten seater. 

Priya 
I’ll inform the group 

Aswin 
Hmmm… so ’Operation N’ is a rescue effort to break out Nidarshan from jail.

The camera slowly zooms out and slips behind the door. On the other side of the door, the camera reveals an Asian girl with short hair and glasses, eavesdropping on the conversation with a deadpan expression. She writes down what she hears in a notepad, all in letters of zeroes and ones.

Jiapei retreats back to her room and pulls out her phone. She calls Hisham…

Hisham 
What’s the matter, Jiapei 

Jiapei 
Lord Hisham- Beep-Beep- SIA has uncovered your plan. Beep-Beep- They are coming to Lagoda. Beep-Beep- Change- Beep- Location 

Hisham smiles and ends the call.

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Date: Monday, 4/8/2024. Morning of the Eclipse. Aswin, Negha, Priya, Sai Aiswarya, Sanjana, Rishika, Aadit, Hitha, and Arun all are aboard the ten seater vehicle, with Aswin in the driver’s seat. Negha, Sai Aiswarya, and Priya are in the backseat working on their shell project, coding as fast as they can. All of the guardians are extremely tense. The stress and the silence are palpable. 

Hitha
This Cult scares me. The way they all look tranced, almost ghost-like. 

Hitha shivers 

Rishika
I agree. They give me the Jeepers!

Aadit
If only there was an easy way to bring them down- to break them free of the curse 

Aswin 
There is 

Hitha 
Huh?

Sai Aiswarya
It was like magic… my tears fell into Negha’s extremely long overdue expired Grande White Mocha… and it created the cure.

Aswin 
We can try recreating this… let’s pull up to the nearest Starbucks 

Aswin takes the next exit and brings the car to the drive through. 

Starbucks Lady 
Hi, what can I do for you today?

Aswin 
Hey, good afternoon. Hope you're having a nice day. I would like 50 Grande White Mochas. Thank you very much.

Starbucks Lady  
Um…okay… Pick up your order at the next window.

Aswin and the SIA Guardians collect the entirety of the grande white mochas and empty the contents of the containers into a clear plastic barrel, the same one used to dispense rose milk at SIA member socials. 

Aswin 
Get out the weapons.

Negha exits the car and goes to the Dickey, where she pulls out a black suitcase. The suitcase is meant for extremely confidential equipment. It is lock protected and bulletproof, keeping it safe from enemies.  

Negha presses her fingerprint on the scanner of the suitcase. The suitcase reads the print, compares it with SIA approved fingerprints, and then mechanically opens the suitcase, revealing its contents.

10 water guns lie inside the suitcase.

Negha brings the suitcase to the car.

Negha
Ok, we’re going to have to fill these water guns with the mochas.

Sai Aiswarya
But wait! The mocha was golden that day! Our tears are needed to create the cure!

Negha
How can you be sure?

Sai Aiswarya 
I’m a chemist. I have a chemistry minor*. The chemical components of the tears will react with the components of the mocha to create a perfect concoction- that serves as a cure for hypnosis 

Rishika 
Ok, so we’re going to need to cry- a lot 

Aswin 
Ok girls, start crying!

Negha
I can’t cry on demand, I need something to cry about!

Sai Aiswarya 
Same!

Aadit
Just continue working on your project and the tears will come naturally. 

Sai Aiswarya and Negha resume coding, while SriHitha and Rishika sit by them, collecting samples of tears. 

Sai Aiswarya tests her code and gets multiple errors 

Sai Aiswarya 
Crying
This is traumatizing

Negha
NO! Another seg fault!

Negha bursts into uncontrollable tears

Rishika 
Hitha, position!

Hitha places a water bottle under Negha’s eyes. The bottle gets filled up completely in less than a minute. She passes the bottle to Rishika, who has the container of mocha in her hands. 

Rishika pours the bottle into the container and uses a stirrer to mix the liquids.

Aadit on the other end dispenses the liquid cure into the water guns. 

Aswin looks into the camera and smiles.

Aswin 
Smiling
Our weapons are ready…

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Hisham drives his 10 seater vehicle at the speed of light. Two other ten seaters follow him. The three vehicles pass a sign that reads: “Welcome to Brownsburg”

Hisham takes a turn into a park, and the other two cars follow. The cars pass a sign that reads: “Williams Park”

Over the course of the next hour, Hisham and his cult set up base. They ready the equipment needed to perform the rock conversion.

Hisham opens up a suitcase. Inside are 10 different red chettiar rocks. Sahil and Anurag stand on either side of him. The bride joins in as well.

Hisham
Fellow Jais, these are the remainder of the rocks. And 2 rocks I’ve kept separate for emergency purposes. 

Anurag 
What are these rocks being used for?

Hisham 
We are going to convert these rocks using the power of the eclipse in… 

Hisham checks his watch 

Hisham 
In exactly 2 hours! And then we will use 2 of these rocks, put them in the ChettiarBlaster, and then break out Nidarshan from Jail! 

The Bride
Then what about the other 8?

Hisham 
Smiling 
4 rocks to destroy West Lafayette…another 4 to destroy Lafayette! 

The Bride 
That is just so Tu!

Hisham, Anurag, Sahil, and the Bride maniacally start laughing at an extremely high pitch. Suddenly, they are interrupted. An elderly man places his hand on Hisham’s shoulder.

Old Man 
“Excuse us, me and my wife from Wisconsin wanted to take pictures of the eclipse and we were already in this spot. Could you kind kids move over just a little bit so we can set up our camera right here?

The man brings out his extremely expensive standing camera. His elderly wife smiles at Hisham. 

Hisham smiles back at the lady.

Sahil grabs the camera and snaps it in half.

Old Lady 
What are you doing!?!?!?

Hisham grabs the man and spins him in the air twenty times as his wife begs him to stop.

Old man 
Aaaaaauuagaaah!

Old Lady 
Please let him go, we’re just here on vacation! 

Hisham flings the man in the air and the man goes flying out into the distance. He lands on the top of a tree. 

Anurag grabs the lady and spins her around. Then, Anurag and Sahil play catch with the lady.

Old Lady 
Please, just put me down!!!

Anurag flings the lady in the opposite direction, and she lands in the playground.

Hisham, Sahil, and Anurag do a group dance, the Aztec Ritual, before moving on to discuss the next of their plans. 

———----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—

Aswin
All right SIA, we’re here! Welcome to Lagoda, Indiana!

Hitha 
Wow, I can’t believe I’m finally here!

Aswin drives to the park where the cult has supposedly set up camp. He parks the car and the gang gets out of the car. They realize something is amiss. 

Rishika
Huh, this park is empty

Negha
Where is the cult?

The SIA guardians search the park for the next 30 minutes. There is not a single soul in this run down park. 

Aadit
That’s it. It’s all over. 

Priya 
Hisham’s and his cult are going to win. They’ve outsmarted us

Sai Aiswarya
I guess we are going to be facing the return of Nidarshan 


Rishika 
The eclipse is going to happen very soon!

Sanjana
Aswin, is there anything we can do?

Aswin shakes his head, and then puts his head in his hands. He is truly stunned and clueless as to where Hisham actually is.

Aswin 
Thinking 
We can’t lose, we just can’t. The fate of the world is in our hands, if Nidarshan comes, cities will be reduced to crumbles. The world will face destruction. And here we are stranded, without any way to stop them. 

The group is devastated. They all depressingly sit in the grass, on the verge of losing. And suddenly, from the direction of the sun, a bright light starts to emerge, and gets closer, and closer, and closer.
