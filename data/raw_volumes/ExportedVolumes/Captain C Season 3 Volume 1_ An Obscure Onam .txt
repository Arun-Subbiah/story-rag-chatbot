Aswin Chidambaram Kumar sits at a table on the second floor of Rawls in the open space, surrounded by the mountainous tasks in front of him; he is drowning in homework. It’s already past 12am. 

Aswin finishes typing his lab report and briefly closes his laptop to take a break. He takes out his phone and then watches a few reels. Suddenly, a faint sound echoes from outside, near the Purdue Arch. Aswin looks out the window.

“We are SAATH” 

“We are SAATH”

“We are SAATH”

Aswin smiles. A group of boys and girls chant “We are SAATH” as they cross Grant St and post their posters on the lampposts. 

Aswin 
Thinking 
A mental health group targeting the South Asian Community… What an awesome idea!

Compilation of Aswin studying and finishing his assignments. He drinks some water, ties his shoes, packs up his things, and starts to head out the building. Aswin puts his copy of the Chettiar Prophecy in the second compartment of his bag. He crosses the street, and as he does, from the corner of his eye he spots the SAATH poster on the black lamppost.

Aswin walks up to the poster and reads: “We are SAATH launches a new student run political party: The SAATH Party. We will be contesting in the Purdue Student Government Presidential Elections” 

Aswin 
Saath in politics? This race will definitely be interesting to watch. I wonder who they will  nominate….

Negha stands in the middle of a park, surrounded by tall dark green trees that reach for the sky. 

The sky is getting darker and darker minute by minute. 

Negha looks around for people she knows at the park, but they are all unfamiliar faces. Where are her friends?

Negha runs to a nearby man. 

Negha
Sir, where am I? What park is this?

The man slowly turns around. He takes his sunglasses off to reveal his face.

Hisham creepily smiles at Negha. 

Negha screams in deep fear and runs away. She runs to a nearby woman.

Negha 
Ma’am, help me! He’s dangerous!

The woman turns around. It’s the bride. The bride flips her hair and whispers creepily: Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai

Negha backs away in panic, but bumps into someone behind her. She is face to face with the sly smile of Nidarshan. Nidarshan, Hisham, and the Bride start surrounding her, all chanting Jai. More surrounding people join in the crowd, completing the rest of the cult. 

Negha is reminded of her awful and traumatic memories of being in the cult. She can’t take it anymore. This is too much.

Negha
Please… just leave me alone… leave me alone… leave me… 

Negha bolts up in her bed, drowning in sweat. Her eyes are dazed and her hair is messy. Sai Aiswarya and Priya rush to her side.

Priya 
Negha! It’s okay… It’s all okay…

Sai Aiswarya
Are you traumatized?



Priya 
Ever since the battle of brownsburg and since she escaped from the cult, she’s been having awful nightmares…

Sai Aiswarya
Maybe we should take her to PUSH?

Negha
No! It’s alright. I’m alright. 

Priya and Sai Aiswarya look at Negha with concern as the scene fades to black.

Sanjana gets the key for the AAARCC from the mailbox, and opens the doors to the building. Rishika, Aadit, and Hitha stand behind her. 

Hitha
This Onam event is going to be so much fun!

Rishika
Yeah, especially with the premade sambar from the Indian store!

Aadit
So exciting!

Compilation shots of Sanjana bringing up chairs from the basement, Negha cooking rice through the Instapot, and Sai Aiswarya polishing up on the Onam slides. 

Sanjana
Alright, now we can open doors!

Hoards of freshmen storm through the front gates of the AAARCC. The five students take a seat on the couch in the living room. 

Aswin walks in the door and sits on the couch. Once a few more people walk in, Sai Aiswarya starts introductions and then her presentation.

After the presentation is done, everyone begins to line up for sambar, chips from the blue chip bag, and rice. Here, Aswin mingles with some new faces. 

“Hi I’m Chockalingam” 


Aswin 
Very nice to meet you, I’m Aswin. What are you studying?

Chockalingam
I’m a PHD student in Aerospace Engineering.

Aswin 
That’s awesome 

Suddenly, two freshman girls walk in the room.

Aswin 
What are your names

“I’m Raechel Davids” 

“And I’m Mala”

Aswin 
Very nice to meet you both 

Raechel Davids
Why is it that only Telugu people have their own club? Why can’t we Tamil folks have our own club? Would you be interested?

The camera moves around the table and into the kitchen, as Negha prepares another batch of rice. 

Negha’s hand shivers as she pours a cup of water into the instapot. Negha stares at the cup blankly. She is reminded by the haunting memories of her days in the cult, which are constantly interrupting her when she does everyday tasks.  

Negha’s hand slips, and the water falls to the ground.

Hitha runs up to Negha.

Hitha
Negha! Are you alright?

Negha
Yeah… accidentally dropped it…

Hitha 
If anything let us know… We are all there for you….

Hitha embraces Negha, as the scene fades to black. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rain steadily falls, gently tapping the roof of the AAARCC. The gentle echo of the rain hitting the roof is heard throughout the building. 

Sanjana
Alright guys, now we are going to have our paper boat competition! 

Hitha
Everyone get your boats you have made and bring them outside!

The crowd of contestants crawl out the door and outside into the rain. Umbrellas of all colors form a rainbow. A bucket filled with water awaits the contestant outside.

Rishika
Alright, who is going first?

The boat competition continues, with boat after boat beating the records of previous boats. The students are having the time of their lives.

As the last boat is racing towards the finish line, it falls to its side halfway. Right at this moment, Aswin comes bursting out the door. 

Aswin 
Guys.. Guys… Look at this!

Aswin shows his phone to the group, open to an Instagram post.

Aswin 
We Are SAATH has finalized its candidate for PSG president! 

Aadit 
Wow, who is it?

Aswin 
It’s none other than our very own….
Niki!
