Aswin sits in the Hawkins lobby, watching the clock. He is growing impatient.

Aswin 
Negha said she would be down any minute now… 

Aswin tries to relax his mind and reflect upon his week. Assignments completed, badminton played, goals met. Most important of all, a crime free week! 

Ever since the Battle of Brownsburg and Hisham’s arrest, West Lafayette has been at peace. Crime rates have dropped and Aswin has not often had to take on the mantle of Captain C. 

Aswin 
Thinking 
Why is she taking so long!

Aswin walks up from the chair and goes to the counter of the service desk. There he picks up a volume of the Exponent. 

Thursday, September 26. Yesterday’s paper. 

The headlines were the usual. Heavilon Hall’s demolition, Professor retiring, the Starry Night Festival coming up, etc.

Aswin flips to the second page. The crime section always sparks his interest. The section lists all the arrests made over the week. 

Aswin chuckles. Usually, more than half of these arrests are made by him. But today, the section is very small. 

Aswin’s eyes move down the page, as a headline catches his attention.

“Multiple Parties around Campus report spiked drinks: Purdue Students in Panic” 

Aswin's eyes raise in alarm. The newspaper details that multiple parties have been dealing with this issue. The newspaper marks this as a rise in drug trafficking within West Lafayette. The newspaper states that police have no idea where this sudden surge in drug imports is coming from. 

The author of the article asks the same question that Aswin has ringing in his mind: Is there a new big player or supplier in the drug market in West Lafayette, the next after Nidarshan? 

As Aswin ponders upon this potential new issue, the elevator door gently slides open. Negha walks through and taps Aswin on the shoulder. Aswin is startled. 

Aswin 
Right on time 

Negha raises her eyebrows

Negha
I was busy putting up the latest story along with Prasiddhi! We put up a Niki support poster on the SIA story!

Aswin 
Are you ready to watch Niki kill this debate?

Aswin and Negha cross the Mitch Daniels and Grant Street intersection, and make their way to the PMU. They walk over to Starbucks, where the Purdue Student Government presidential debate is about to take place. 

Aswin and Negha run into the rest of the SIA gang, including Priya, Rishika, Aadit, Hitha, Sanjana, Arun, and Sai Aiswarya. 

The debate stage is adjacent to Starbucks, and is the stage where students usually perform musical instruments or songs. The area surrounding the stage is decorated in red, white, and blue. A banner hangs behind the stage reading “Presidential Debate.” Rows of seats are filled before the stage. The SIA groups fill up an entire row, blending into the massive crowd of around fifty people. 

Aswin 
Wow, the turnout is almost as much as the Onam event! 

The SIA group shoots Aswin a nasty glare. 

The candidates walk up onto the stage and take seats adjacent to each other. They each sit behind a table, with a name card before each of them. 

Aswin focuses on the candidates. There are four candidates, and their faces are similar… 

Niki is sitting third on the stage. She crosses her leg and is wearing a very Hillary Clinton-esque outfit, giving off a Michelle Obama vibe.

Aswin shifts his head to the right, to notice the candidate sitting next to Niki. His name is Jeff. 

Aswin moves his head to the left. On the direct left of Niki, there is a young boy named Rahul. Aswin focuses his eyes. The boy is familiar. Was he at an SIA event?

Aswin looks at the candidate at the end of the stage, and his eyes flare in alarm. It is Gurtej, of the Sikh Student Association. 

The host of the debate sits to the right of all the candidates, at the side of the stage. The host’s name tag reads “Mukund.” Mukund adjusts his mic, and begins to speak.

Mukund 
Alright everyone, welcome to the Purdue Student Government Presidential Debate!
We are going to start off this debate by introducing our candidates! We will start left to right.

Gurtej 
Hi my name is Gurtej, I’m a computer science major from Hyderabad. Junior. I’m here to advocate for the expansion and development of the CS program here at Purdue. I’m running on behalf of the SSA party. 

Negha
Whispering to the group 
He’s a criminal! 

Rahul
Hi everyone, my name is Rahul and I am a freshman from Tamil Nadu. I’m running independently as I wanted to get a feel for public speaking. 

Niki 
Hello everyone, my name is Niki and I am a junior majoring in Psychology. I am running on behalf of the SAATH party. I feel that mental health, especially within the South Asian community, does not get enough attention. If I am elected, I would like to expand the attention and resources dedicated to mental health and mental health education. I would also like to advocate for the construction of a new residence hall to address the housing crisis. 

Niki gets multiple claps from the crowd.




Jeff
Hi everyone, I’m Jeff and I work at Purdue Dining. I’m here to advocate for Purdue Dining worker’s rights. 

Mukund
Alright, and with that, we’ll start the debate. Our first topic: let’s talk about campus safety. With the recent concerns about spiked drinks at parties, what steps can be taken to address this issue?

Gurtej
Umm.. I think.. Um… the best approach is to have students be more responsible? Like watching your drinks at all times, dressing more responsibly, etc.

Gurtej draws gasps from the crowd. 

Niki
Actually Gurtej, we need to create an environment where students feel safe without having to constantly watch their backs. Purdue should implement better lighting in key areas, especially near party zones. We could also establish more visible patrols and create a campus-wide program with local authorities to monitor parties. Proactive measures like these make it easier for students to focus on enjoying their time rather than constantly worrying about safety.

The crowd bursts into applause. The SIA guardians in the audience can not contain their smiles. 

Mukund 
Niki, that is just an excellent, amazing point you have brought up!

Gurtej uncomfortably shifts in his seat, declining his chance to respond to Niki with a rebuttal. 

Mukund 
Let’s move on to the next topic: student housing. What are your thoughts on the growing demand for more residence halls on campus?

Niki 
We can’t just add a few more beds here and there. I’m proposing a completely new residence hall, designed with sustainability in mind, and one that better reflects the diversity of the student body. A facility where everyone feels at home and can thrive.

Rahul 
Well, I think the housing crisis could be solved if students just... uh... stopped being so picky about where they live. I mean, it’s not that hard to just find a place and make do, right

The crowd shakes their heads disapprovingly. 

Niki 
Actually, Rahul, I don’t think asking students to settle for subpar housing is the solution. Many students, especially international ones, face unique challenges when it comes to finding affordable and comfortable housing. It’s not about being ‘picky,’ it’s about meeting basic needs—privacy, safety, and quality of life. We need to ensure that every student has access to housing that supports their success, not just a place to crash

The crowd bursts into applause and stands up to give Niki a standing ovation. 

Mukund
Niki, you are a genius! These are excellent points you have brought up!

The SIA guardians are elated with excitement. 

Aswin turns to the rest of the group.

Aswin 
It looks like we got ourselves a president!

Cut to End Credits.
