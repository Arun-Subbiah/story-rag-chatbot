Sai Aiswarya stands nervously on the dark grey stage, looking at the audience in fear. The warm room is filled with a crowd of Tamil folks. A banner hangs above her head, reading: “Jubail Toastmasters Club.” 

Sai Aiswarya scans the crowd, looking for her parents. Her parents sit in the second row. Her dad has a video camera in hand. Her mom sits beside, encouraging Sai Aiswarya with her eyes. 

Mom 
Whispering 
You can do this!

Sai Aiswarya smiles. Her mother’s words of encouragement are her golden potion of motivation. Now, she has all the confidence to rock the stage. 

Sai Aiswarya looks down at herself. She is dressed in a silver-blue outfit with a pink skirt and pink leggings. Purple wings expand from both of her sides. Above her forehead lies the mask of a unicorn. 

Sai Aiswarya continues to scan the crowd. In the second row sits the man who taught her to dance in the previous toastmasters’ event. A row behind, and a few seats to the right sits a very familiar face: Manjula Sridhar. 

Sai Aiswarya smiles at Manjula Sridhar. But Manjula Sridhar does not smile back. Sai Aiswarya’s smile falters. The air, once warm and pleasant, is slowly freezing. 

Manjula Sridhar’s face remains eerily still, and her eyes lock into Sai Aiswarya’s eyes with terror. Manjula Sridhar’s lips curl into a wide and eerie grin, and her teeth sharpen into knives. Her eyes slowly darken, before fully turning blood red. 

Sai Aiswarya is breathless, scared, lost. Manjula Sridhar starts to scream in a wail of fury, at the top of her lungs. The crowd is oblivious. 

Sai Aiswarya begins to cry, tears flowing like a waterfall down her cheek.

Suddenly, the stage collapses beneath her feet. Sai Aiswarya plunges into a deep abyss, falling and falling and falling without hitting the ground. Everything around her is dark and hollow. The wind rushes past her and there is no bottom- just an endless plunge into nothing. And through this fall, she hears a low, distorted voice- laughing. 

Sai Aiswarya bolts up from her bed, her heart hammering in her chest. She gasps for air as the creepy laughter still echoes through her ears. She frantically looks around her room, making sure she is safe from the horrors of the nightmare.

The SIA guardians sit together at a table in front of Aatish at the PMU. The table is populated by multiple Hyderabad House biryani orders. 

Aswin opens up his Vijayawada Chicken Biryani and serves it on his plate. He takes a whiff of the biryani off his plate, and admires all the ingredients and spice that went into it. 

Aswin takes a handful of biryani into his hands, gently pours the saalna into his hand, and throws the biryani in his mouth, downing the quantity in one bite.

Aswin 
And that’s how you make biryani!

Aswin looks around at the others, who are watching him curiously. 

Negha turns to Sanjana. 

Negha 
Sanjana, where’s Sai?

Sanjana
Sai has a really bad nightmare during her evening nap. She couldn’t come, she’s still recovering 

Negha
Oh my god is she okay? Is she traumatized?

Sanjana
She’s better now, I think she’ll be good by tomorrow

Negha 
Ok good

Hitha turns and looks at Niki, who is sitting across from her.

Hitha
So Niki, how was your day?

Niki doesn’t respond and is distracted by something on her phone.

Hitha
Niki?

Niki bolts up in alarm, and drops her phone to the ground. She picks it up with panic.

Niki 
Sorry! I’ve just been super distracted with the whole election thing…

Hitha
Why, what’s up?

Niki shows Hitha her phone. It is open to Reddit, where students are discussing the last debate.

Niki 
I’ve just been super stressed. I’m constantly reading online discourse to see what people are saying about me. I’m scared about how this election is going to go….

Hitha
Niki, it’s going to be alright don’t worry. I think we just need something to distract you…

Sanjana
And distract Sai…

Priya 
And Negha…

Aadit 
And I just have the perfect distraction: A trip to Indiana Dunes!

Aswin 
Indiana Dunes?

Aadit 
Yeah, Indiana Dunes! A perfect way to distract ourselves from the everyday stresses of college life! 

The group looks around at each other and nods. 

Aswin 
Sounds like a plan. We’ll go September 28th, this Saturday. It’s also National Public Lands Day! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The friends arrive at Indiana Dunes state park and excitedly jump out the cars, eager to get into the water. The boys and girls run down the hill with joy.

Aadit takes off his shirt and jumps into the water with a plop. The rest of the girls get into the water with small jumps. As the water splashes away, so do their concerns.

The SIA group spends hours in the water and in the sand, in the joy and the happiness. Their day is made.

Aswin throws around a frisbee to Hitha, and Hitha races to catch it before it hits the ground. She makes a dive!

Aswin takes out his phone and does some research.

Aswin 
This restaurant seems to be a good pick. Taste of India in Merrillville.

Negha
But we have to make it back before dance practice!

Niki 
Ooh, and we should get ice-cream at Azucar!

Aswin 
Amazing, ice cream with a Mexican twist sounds grea-

Suddenly, a scream is heard from the distance. Aswin turns and looks to the distance, into the near sea. 

A young boy is drowning, grasping for breath about 20 feet away. 

Aswin’s Chettiar instinct rings in and he bolts into action. 

Aswin 
Yells
I’m coming!

Aswin swims through the harsh waters, roughened by the strong winds. He grabs the boy in his arms and rescues him back to safety on the sand. 


Boy 
Thank you for saving me! You’re my hero!

Aswin 
Young boy, I am everyone’s hero.

Boy 
My name is Dave, what is yours?

Aswin 
My name is Aswin. Me and my friends are here from Purdue

The SIA guardians stand behind Aswin, smiling.

Dave 
Oh! My older brother goes to Purdue. His name is Jeff!

Aswin 
That’s awesome.

Dave runs over to his bag and pulls out a red box. He hands it over to Aswin. 

Dave
Here is a box of my favorite chocolates. As a gift for saving my life.

Aswin smiles at the boy as the boy turns around and runs away back to his family.

The SIA guardians continue on with their day in joy, happy that they have overcome their fears and are having a great time.
