Aswin walks into the PMU ballroom and is greeted by the elated faces of the SIA board members who are setting up the Cinefest event.

Aadit
Hi Aswin! How was New York?

Aswin 
It was an excellent trip. We were wearing NYPD hats and so many people thought we were police officers!

Hitha
That’s crazy bro 

Aswin 
What an amazing few weeks. First Shanks came here to Purdue. And then Subra and Veerappan. And now the New York trip

Negha
Aswin come help with the set up 

The SIA gang sets up the structure at the entrance, where the lights form a tunnel for people walking in.

Arun 
Where is Saiswarya?

Negha
She is printing out the movie posters at WALC with Priya

Arun 
Can I help?

Negha 
She will be here soon. 

Sanjana
Guys the food is here! Who wants to help pick it up? 

Arun 
I’ll come 

Sanjana, Arun, and Vineeth go to pick up the food. People have started to line up outside the entrance, awaiting for the exciting exhilarating event to start.

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

Sanjana, Arun, and Vineeth walk back to the event room carrying the food in their hands.

Sanjana
God that guy was scary

Vineeth 
He has a DUI

Sai Aiswarya
That is Traumatizing 

Vineeth 
Hopefully he didn’t do anything to the food

Aswin has started to set up the trays on the food table on the far end of the hall. Meanwhile, Negha is talking to some of the independent performers about their upcoming performances.

The whole hall is radiating with palpable joy and energy. The far walls are lined up with movie posters, from Ghilli to Manchithrazhu. An archery booth and multiple exciting games are also set up. The hall is set up in a red theme, giving it a fun and movie red carpet like vibe. 

The performances begin! First a North Indian girl dances to songs from all South Indian languages. Next, a girl seductively sings Oo Antava while her friend sensually dances to the song. 

Meanwhile, Aswin is serving rose milk at the food table. At a distance away from  him, two girls are approaching the table. 

Raechel Davids
Let’s get rose milk!

Mala
Ooh sounds tasty!

The girls stylishly walk up to Aswin. Aswin starts to pour the rose milk into the two cups. 

Aswin 
How are you both doing? Have a very nice day

Raechel Davis
Doing well, thank you

Aswin 
Have a very nice day 

Aswin reaches out the cup filled with rose milk to Raechel Davids. As Raechel Davids grasps her hand around the cup, a stick-on red fingernail extension attached to her nail falls and hits the floor. In the commotion, Raechel Davids drops the entire cup.

Raechel Davids
Oops! These nails are so bad, always falling off. I need to get higher quality ones!

Aswin 
Would you like another cup? Have a very nice day!

Raechel Davids 
No that’s alright

Aswin 
Have a very nice day

Raechel Davids and Mala walk away gossiping. Negha walks by and stands next to Aswin.

Aswin 
Well that was odd

Negha
Yeah it was 

Negha is suddenly alarmed as she notices something on Aswin.

Negha
Aswin! Your neck!

Aswin 
Huh?

Negha
There’s a bright red bump on your neck 

Aswin puts his hand on his neck, and is instantly alarmed when his finger moves up over the red bump.

Aswin 
Oh…It’s probably nothing?

Negha
Yeah…

Aswin's eyes wander to the nearest trash can. 

Aswin 
Bruh someone just threw away a full cup of rose milk. 

Sanjana
Hi everyone, the SIA board members and friends have put together a dance! We have put a lot of hard work and effort into this dance with weekly practices, choreographed by our vice president Negha. We hope you enjoy it!

Negha runs over from the rose milk stand to the side of the stage. Aswin holds up his phone to record the performance before the stage. The music starts to fill up the ballroom. Illuminati starts blaring….

…


The group hits the final step of Maari Thara Local and bows. Suddenly a scream is heard from across the room. 

Aswin quickly puts the phone back in his pocket and races across the room to see what the commotion is all about.

A boy is on the floor and a cup of spilled rose milk is right beside him. His friend is panicking, trying to wake him up.

Aswin 
Hey! Young man are you alright!

Boy 
He was just drinking this rose milk, and instantly fainted as he was walking. 

Aswin observes around the room. Multiple people are passed out on to tables, their faces meeting the table. They all have cups of rose milk beside them.

Negha runs up to the scene. 

Aswin 
The rose milk! It must have been spiked! 

Negha
Who could this be!?

Aswin 
I don’t know… Wait! I was reading about it this report in the exponent where-

As Aswin’s eyes scan the room, he suddenly makes eye contact with a familiar Indian boy. 

The boy’s eyebrows raise in alarm, and he is shocked. He instantly pivots his feet, and races towards the exit. 

Aswin 
Hey! Get back here! 

Aswin races after the boy. The fate of SIA is on the line.
