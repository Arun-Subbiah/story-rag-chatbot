A boy falls to the floor with a cup of spilled rose milk beside him. Aswin races to the situation. As he observes around the room, he sees multiple people passed out on their tables. They all have cups of rose milk beside them. As Aswin’s eyes scan the room, he suddenly makes eye contact with a familiar Indian boy. The boy’s eyebrows raise in alarm, and he is shocked. He instantly pivots his feet, and races towards the exit. He races out the door with a Rajini cutout. Aswin chases after him…

Students crowd around a TV in Walk-ons at the PMU. The TV channel is set to the local West Lafayette News channel, which is telecasting the live results of the Purdue Student Government Presidential Election. 

Student 1
I bet you Gurtej is going to win. His points made the most sense.

Student 2
But what about Rahul? He did a great job as well…	

The channel resumes from a commercial back to the live coverage. 

News Anchor

The tension in the room is palpable. The students all hold their breaths, waiting for the news of their lives.

As Aswin’s eyes scan the room, he suddenly makes eye contact with a familiar Indian boy. The boy’s eyebrows raise in alarm, and he is shocked. The boy instantly pivots his feet, and races towards the exit. Aswin chases after him.

The boy shoves a few people to the side as he stumbles through the crowd and out the front entrance. As he races through the PMU, he looks back and there is no Aswin behind him. He sighs a breath of relief and continues his way down the steps, past the Purdue Campus scaled model. He takes off his backpack, makes sure everything inside is safe, and puts it back on his shoulders. (All this time, the camera does not completely reveal his face).

The boy is breathing heavily. 

Boy 
Great, I lost him. 

The boy opens the door to exit the PMU and reach a realm of safety. He bumps into someone on the other side of the doorway. 

Cut to a close shot the boy’s eyes, filled with fear. 

The boy has come face to face with Aswin. 

Aswin stares the boy down with a lens of analysis. The boy is indeed familiar. 

Aswin 
I know you!

Aswin explores the deep depths of his memory and comes back to the surface with a name.

Aswin 
Rahul! You were debating against Niki in the presidential debate!

Rahul does not speak and his face displays fear.

Aswin 
Give me your bag!

Aswin takes the bag out of Rahul’s hands. 

He unzips the first compartment of the bag. There is a tag on the zipper reading ‘NTS.’ Inside, there are hundreds of sleeping pills.

Aswin 
So these are the pills you’ve been mixing in at all these parties! You’re the most wanted man in Purdue 

Rahul bites his lip.

Aswin unzips the second compartment of the bag. Inside there are thousands of small slips of paper, each with a thumbprint. 

Aswin’s eyebrows raise in shock. He is unable to speak. 

Aswin 
You…you… you’ve been trying to swing the election in your favor!

Rahul does not speak.

Aswin 
You’ve been drugging people at parties, getting their thumbprints, and passing it off as votes for you and your party! This is blatant election fraud! Let me call the police. 

Rahul 
Thinking 
At least the rest of it is all safe… we should already be good. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The police cars leave the entrance of the PMU with the arrested Rahul. The handcuffed Rahul watches from the back of the car, menacingly staring down Aswin. Aswin smiles back at him, with the joy that the job is finished. 

Aswin 
The biggest threat of the semester, eliminated. This is the safest this campus has been, even with the drinks being spiked at parties. And now even that is gone

Aswin exhales 

Aswin 
Life. 

The rest of the SIA guardians walk out the door and surround Aswin. Niki leads the group. 

Niki 
Aswin! Guess what! 

Aswin 
What?

Niki 
I won! I won the election! I am now the Purdue Student Government President from 2024-2025! 

Aswin 
That’s awesome

The group breaks out into cheers and starts dancing in front of the PMU in joy. What a moment for this squad. 

Niki 
The construction for the new residence hall has begun! My name is going to go down in history!

Aswin 
That’s awesome

Niki 
This campus is going to be forever changed

Aswin 
That’s awesome

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The group is extremely tired after a long day of cleaning and packing up in the aftermath of the Cinefest event.

Negha
That was a successful event!

Sai Aiswarya 
What a great time

Negha 
Does anyone want to get boba?

Niki 
I can’t… I’m extremely tired… you guys have fun though!

The group waves to Niki as she leaves the ballroom. The camera tracks her walking down the halls of the PMU, across the signal of Mitch Daniels Blvd and Grant St, past Rawls, Harry’s Chocolate shop, Von’s, and Jimmy John’s, and through the front entrance of Campus Edge. 

She hums to the tune of her favorite Taylor Swift song as she ascends the floors of the building via the elevator. 

Niki exits the elevator and walks along the unique dull green walls. She reaches the end of the hallway and stands in front of her door. Niki gets out her keys and turns it through the keyhole. She opens the door. 

The door swings open. The camera follows Niki as she walks through the doors and sits on the far end of her couch. The rest of her room isn’t revealed yet.

Niki crosses her legs and smiles. The camera moves from Niki’s smile to the other end of the couch, where Nidarshan and Chawin sit, smiling along with Niki.
