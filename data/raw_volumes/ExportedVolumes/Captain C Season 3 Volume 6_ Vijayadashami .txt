Sai Aiswarya sets up the marudhani stand at the far right corner of the ballroom, the same ballroom where one week ago, the Cinefest was held.

Sanjana
Two events in two weeks!

Priya
I know, it’s crazy!

Negha sets out the Carrom board table and pieces. 

Negha
Everyone’s gonna love this

Sai Aiswarya
How’s the Golu set up going! 

Hitha
It’s complete! 

The group turns around to face the golu that has now been completely set up. Their jaws drop in awe. 

Negha
It’s absolutely beautiful 

Aswin 
I sent a picture to my mum, and she says ‘hats off!’ 

Sai Aiswarya
People are already starting to line up. Should we start letting them in?

Sanjana
Yes we can. Vijayadashami is about to begin!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Students have started to enter the event and take their seats at various tables scattered across the hall. Sanjana grabs the mic and gets ready to make her announcement.

Sanjana
Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Cinefest! 

The crowd stares at Sanjana blankly. 

Sanjana
Oops, sorry. Welcome to Vijayadashami! Everyone can start lining up for food now. 

Hordes of students race from their seats and to the food line. Raechel Davids leads the pack. The scene resembles a stampede of thirsty elephants racing to a nearby lake. 

Negha
Well look at them go

Aswin 
I know right, have a very nice day 

Negha 
Aswin! There are bumps all over your neck and arms.

Aswin analyzes his body.  There are bright red rashes.

Aswin 
I… I didn’t see… I don’t know 

Negha
Anyways, Aswin, where is the camera?

Aswin 
I left it in the kitchen.

Negha
Help me find it

Aswin and Negha walk to the kitchen. Aswin is distracted by watching reels on his phone. Negha opens up a bag. Aswin’s eyes move over from his phone to the bag. 

Aswin 
Negha, that’s the wrong bag!


Negha 
Oopsie Boba!

As Negha is zipping up the bag, she notices something that makes her audibly gasp. Her face seems as if she has been slapped by a ghost. 

Negha
Scared
Aswin..Aswin…Look…

Aswin puts his phone in his pocket and looks through the opening of the bag that the zippers make. Inside, there are multiple red and blue wires connected to a main circuit box. The box has a display that reads a countdown: 2 hours to go. 

Negha
Is it a boba maker?

Aswin 
Negha, it’s a bomb!

Negha faints and passes out onto the ground.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sai Aiswarya splatters water on Negha’s face. Negha instantly bolts up and adjusts her eyes to the sight of Aswin messing with the bomb.

Aswin 
Negha! Good, you’re up. I’m just using my mechanical engineering skills to try to defuse this bomb. 

Sai Aiswarya
The bomb squad has already been called, they are on their way

The SIA guardians crowd around Aswin as he works his way through the bomb. The pressure is mounting upon them. The attendees are not aware of the peril in the kitchen. 

Aswin detaches a compartment of the bomb. The pieces slide off and two wires are seen inside. Aswin’s hands tremble as he clutches the scissor. 

Aswin
Thinking 
Why am I so dizzy?

Aswin cuts one of the two wires, and the timer on the display disappears.

Aswin 
It’s defused!

The SIA Guardians clap for Aswin. 

Negha
Wait… what’s that red thing in there?

Negha is pointing to the compartment of the bomb of which Aswin just defused the bomb in. Inside, a single woman’s red stick-on nail lies. 

Aswin 
Thinking 
Why is this so familiar?

Aswin remembers.  

Aswin 
Get Raechel Davids! Now! 

The guardians race out the kitchen and into the main event hall. There are crowds of people packed everywhere.

Negha
How are we ever going to find her?

Aswin 
Split up! 

The guardians split up across the hall and work through the crowd separately. The camera tracks Negha. 

Negha frantically looks around the room, quickly pushing past people. Suddenly, a girl with a red dress catches her eye. The girl is trying to make a run for the door!

Negha 
Stop right there! 

Negha races after Raechel Davids as fast as he can. Raechel realizes she is being pursued and runs even faster. Before she can even process it, Raechel is tackled by Negha from the back.
Negha blows a strand of hair out of her face. 

Negha
Matcha!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the kitchen, Raechel Davids is all tied up against a pole. The SIA Guardians surround her, waiting for answers. 

Negha analyzes Raechel Davids’ hand. There is a missing red fingernail extension. 

Aswin 
Explain yourself, Davids! 

Raechel Davids
Everything you believe about this bomb, the election, it’s all wrong!

Aswin 
What?

Raechel Davids
There are bombs scattered all around campus, each one scheduled to blast 2 hours after the last one. 

The guardians are absolutely shocked 

Aswin 
Why would you do this!?!?

Raechel Davids
Me? Ha Ha Ha Ha. We are a whole network. I’ve only set up this bomb. The rest of our group has set up bombs all over campus. By the end of today, we will have created an active warzone of disarray. We will control the campus!

Aswin 
Your group? Are you affiliated with Rahul? Did you also assist in influencing the election? 

Raechel 
Rahul? You think we were influencing the election on Rahul’s behalf? Everything on that stage was fake, from the candidates to the host. Rahul, Mukund, Jeff, and Gurtej. My gang NTS: Namma Tamil Sangam. We have all been working together to elect our new leader, by influencing the election in her favor, Niki!

Aswin slowly loses his balance and his head starts spinning, as if it was in a flushing toilet. 

Negha
Aswin, what’s wrong! 

Aswin falls to the ground on his back and becomes unconscious. The red bumps on the back of his neck and arms are visible. They are all over him, covering him. Everyone rushes to his side in panic. 

Negha
Our thalaivar is down!

Aswin is on the ground unresponsive. Niki is revealed as the mastermind behind the bomb. Multiple bombs have been planted all around campus, planned to blast consecutively throughout the day. The SIA Guardians are without their leader, faced with the impossible task of protecting the campus from permanent damage and death. Will the heroes succeed?

Niki meditates alone on the ground in a room with black walls, black furniture, black everything. The words SAATH is written in blood across the wall behind her. 

The camera zooms out, revealing a cauldron in front of her. The camera slowly pans inside the cauldron, where a dark swirling mixture is beginning to brew…
