Recap of Vijayadashami Part One: Aswin is on the ground unresponsive. Niki is revealed as the mastermind behind the bombs. Everyone on the debate stage is revealed to have been working together to influence the election in Niki’s favor. Multiple bombs have been planted all around campus, planned to blast consecutively throughout the day. The SIA Guardians are without their leader, faced with the impossible task of protecting the campus from permanent damage and death. Will the heroes succeed?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The kitchen of the PMU Ballroom. Raechel Davids is tied up. Aswin is on the ground, unresponsive. The SIA Guardians surround him, at his support. Raechel Davids smiles as she views the scene.

Arun 
We have to take him to PUSH!

Negha
I can do that! 

Negha lifts up Aswin and puts him on her shoulders with little effort. She then runs out the door.

Sai Aiswarya 
So tell us Davids, what is Nidarshan up to?

Raechel Davids 
You are underestimating Niki and her SAATH powers. She is the strongest witch in the underworld! An expert in dark magic! The whole purpose of her election was to construct a lair for her dangerous concoctions, under the guise of a new residence hall. It’s their new capital for taking over the world. Niki wants to destroy. Nidarshan wanted power. They formed an alliance so Nidarshan could gain power using Niki’s ability to destroy. These bombs have more range of destruction due to Niki’s dark magic that has been infused inside the bombs. Even right this second, she is brewing more and more in the lair….

Sai Aiswarya
We have to go to the lair and stop Niki!

Raechel Davids
What! She’s not in the lair! How do you know that!?!?

Sai Aiswarya 
Gang, let’s all rush to the Niki Hall and save the campus!


Arun 
But do you really think we can do it without our Captain, Captain C?

Sai Aiswarya
We have to try. 

The SIA Guardians all quickly stand up, appearing confident. However, on the inside they are all trying to hide their fear. The biggest task of their lives, their need to save the world, without their leader. Would winning even be close to possible?

Raechel Davids
Hey, let me go!

The SIA Guardians run out the door, leaving Raechel Davids behind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain C Title Sequence accompanied by Captain C Theme Song

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Niki meditates alone on the ground in a room with black walls, black furniture, black everything. The words SAATH is written in blood across the wall behind her. The echoes of SAATH are heard. 

The camera zooms out, revealing a cauldron in front of her. The camera slowly pans inside the cauldron, where a dark swirling mixture is beginning to brew. The black liquid starts to bubble. Niki’s smile begins to widen. 

The liquid slowly starts rising to the air Niki uses her wand to move the liquid into the special plastic containers.

The camera moves to a young assistant witch standing in the back of the room, watching Niki intently. 

Niki looks back at the assistant. 

Niki 
Kusuma, please bring in the master 

Kusuma races out the door and brings back a tall man in a suit.

Nidarshan 
How is the progress going along Niki!

Niki 
Very well master Nid. The main bomb is now ready to be deployed.

The camera zooms closer and closer into Nidarshan’s sly evil smile. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SIA Guardian, excluding Aswin and Negha, arrive at Niki Hall, completely out of breath after racing down third street. 

Hitha
It would’ve been nice to have the Captain C Mobile right now!

Sai Aiswarya
I hope Aswin is okay!

Tears begin to form in Sai Aiswarya’s eyes. 

Sai Aiswarya
This is traumatizing 

Arun 
Come on gang, let’s go.

Arun and the rest of the SIA Guardians begin to approach the front door of Niki Hall. Just as Arun is about to open the door, he is sent flying by a kick on the other side of the door. The kick shatters the glass into thousands of pieces. Arun is in the ground 20 feet away, unresponsive. 

The SIA guardians are terrified. Arun has blood all over his face and body, caused by shards of glass that have cut through. They slowly move their eyes from Arun on the ground to the figure who has just kicked him through the door. 

Through the door, a Thailandese man walks through. He is extremely muscular and wears glasses. He may be the most muscular man the group has ever seen.

Hitha
He’s familiar… that’s Niki and Nidarshan’s friend, Chawin!

Chawin 
That’s right! 

The SIA Guardians begin to charge at Chawin one by one. Each of the guardians are met by a strong force of power that sends them to the ground. The guardians all lie on the ground unconscious. Blood is all over their faces and they are all defeated by the unstoppable force that Chawin is. 

In the distance, the blast of a bomb is heard. Tarkington and Wiley hall come crumbling down. 

Chawin sits down in front of the entrance of Niki Hall, in front of the now broken doors. He watches over the defeated guardians and sits as a protector of the hall, buying the time for Nidarshan and Niki to execute their master plan. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negha carries Aswin and places him on the bed inside a hospital room. A doctor comes rushing in. 

Negha 
Doctor, doctor, please provide him service. 

Negha sips on her boba as the doctor examines Aswin. 

Doctor
There’s something off about this young chap! Let me take a blood sample. 

The doctor takes a sample of Aswin’s blood and races out of the room to do some tests. Meanwhile, Negha cries. The doctor then comes rushing back in. 

Doctor
I’ve analyzed his blood sample, it seems he has consumed the ‘I’ Virus in some kind of edible form. But his immune system is so strong, so strong to the extent that it is fighting off the virus! This boy seems to have the qualities of a…a…Chettiar?

Negha
Yes sir, he is a Chettiar. 

Doctor
Unbelievable, I am honored to be in the presence of a Chettiar. 

The Doctor touches the feet of Aswin.

*Inspirational Chettiar Music Plays*

Negha 
I think I read about a cure for this in the Chettiar prophecy! 

Negha reaches into Aswin’s pocket and pulls out the Chettiar prophecy, a book that Aswin studies everyday. 

Negha flips to page 252, and starts frantically reading. Then, she reaches into Aswin’s other pocket and pulls out the ancient Chettiar Rocks from last season. 

Negha 
The prophecy lists two cures. A temporary cure is these ancient chettiar rocks. The second cure is joining his blood with the blood of another Chettiar. Doctor, bring out your blender!

The doctor opens the nearby shelf and brings out his vitamix. Negha places the red chettiar rocks inside the blender and then blends them up. She then takes the solution and nurses it to Aswin. 

Aswin slowly regains his consciousness, but is incredibly weak. 

Negha
Aswin, you’re alright, it’s all okay…

Aswin tries to remove all the tubes attached to him and his oxygen mask. The doctor attempts to stop him. 

Doctor 
Aswin, you are in no condition to fight!
Aswin 
But I must go…I must fight!

The Doctor tries to stop Aswin, but Aswin brushes the Doctor off. The Doctor goes flying into the wall, crushing some of the medical equipment left on the counter. 

Aswin weakly rises to his feet, ready to fight. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Camera shows the entire Purdue Campus in smoke and disarray. Active rescue operations are taking place to save those stuck in buildings and injured by bombs. The death count is growing. The whole campus is shadowed by black smoke and fire all over. Camera zooms over to Niki hall. Cut to Niki’s lair. 

Niki stands with Kusuma and Nidarshan. 



Niki
The biggest bomb yet is deployed. The NTS gang just went out and hid it at the WALC. With this bomb, the stretch from WALC to PMU will all be destroyed!

Nidarshan 
Excellent work Niki!

Suddenly, a call comes from Rahul. 

Rahul 
Witch Niki, there seems to be a problem with the bomb! The timer isn’t starting!

Niki 
Oh my Paragon! Let me call up the bomb manufacturer. 

Niki grabs her phone and rings up Manjula Sridhar, arms dealer from Saudi Arabia. She is a powerful person. 

Manjula Sridhar
What is the matter Niki, is the job done?

Niki 
We’re having trouble. The timer isn’t starting!

Manjula Sridhar
Oh god. This once happened during a bombing attempt at the Toastmasters club! 

Niki
What happened?

Manjula Sridhar
Some uncle foiled the plan! But that's another story. Janani, come over here with the instruction manual! 

Manjula’s assistant brings over the instruction manual. Manjula Sridhar then analyzes the manual. 

Manjula Sridhar 
Swap the purple and pink wires!

Rahul switches the purple and pink wires. The timer starts on the display. Rahul smiles. 


Niki 
Thank you Manjula.

Manjula Sridhar 
I am always honored to be involved with terrorism. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Return of The Chettiar

Chawin sits down in front of the entrance of Niki Hall as a protector of the hall, buying the time for Nidarshan and Niki to execute their master plan. He watches over the defeated and tired out SIA Guardians who lie defeated on the floor. 

He smiles and stretches his muscular arms in boredom. Is there nobody to challenge him? 

Suddenly, from the distance in the setting sun, a blur of two people is seen by Chawin. He squints.

A weak and stumbling Aswin uses Negha as a support to make his steps. The SIA Guardians look up and see Aswin. They are instantly inspired. 

Arun 
Look guys, Aswin and Negha. They’re back!

The Guardians slowly start rising from the ground. They weakly stand, bracing themselves for a fight. 

Aswin stares down Chawin. 

Aswin 
Weakly 
Naan Vanthuten nu sollu! Thirumbi Vandhuten nu sollu! 

Chawin laughs. 

Chawin 
Vaada!


Aswin 
DARKKEY ANNAN!

Suddenly, a man with long curly hair, a red pottu, and a red outfit emerged from the bushes. He begins to sing a rock song with full energy, shaking his head left, right, up, and down.

Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli Puli

Chawin races at Aswin at full force. Negha dodges to the side while the SIA Guardians stand around the scene. Aswin stands defenseless. 

Just as Chawin is about to punch Aswin, Negha throws her Boba at Chawin. Chawin is drowned in Boba and gets caught off guard. 

At this moment, Aswin and the rest of the Guardians use the rest of their remaining might to punch Chawin. Chawin is knocked out cold. 

The recoil of Aswin’s punch hits Aswin hard. Aswin stumbles to the ground. 

The SIA Guardians rush to his side. 

Arun 
Aswin, are you okay!?!

Negha
Arun, give him your blood!

Arun 
What? 

Negha slashes Arun with a pocket knife, the knife that she was gifted for her birthday. She collects the blood in a small container, and pours it in Aswin’s mouth. 

Sai Aiswarya
Ooooh, Chemistry!

The pure blood of a Chettiar provides Aswin energy, allowing him to briefly bring back some of the energy that he has lost. 

The Guardians stand united. 



Aswin
Weakly 
Alright guys… it’s Chettiar time!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Niki meditates with her eyes closed. The concoction in the cauldron starts to form a mobius strip in midair. She is in her dark fully black room, the secret witches lair in the bottom of Niki Hall. 

Nidarshan stands in the back, watching in awe. Kusuma is further behind him. 

Nidarshan 
Thinking 
More destruction is on the way….

Suddenly, the back door swings open. The SIA Guardians, weak and barely able to stand, line up behind the door, in unison. 

Nidarshan 
Kusuma, attack!

Kusuma races towards the guardians at full force. Negha kicks Kusuma, and Kusuma goes flying ten feet backwards. Kusuma is unconscious. 

In the commotion, Nidarshan punches Arun at the moment that Arun is not looking. Nidarshan then sweep kicks Arun, knocking Arun to the floor. Nidarshan grabs a nearby hammer, and then repeatedly swings it all over Arun. Arun is knocked to the ground, unresponsive. 

Aswin 
ARUN, NO!

Aswin kicks Nidarshan. Nidarshan stumbles backwards. 

The rest of the SIA Guardians begin to race towards Niki, with the aim of attacking her. Before they get there, Niki pauses her black magic activity and hovers back to the ground. She takes out her SAATH wand from her black SAATH robe, and deploys spells all over the room. Dark bubbles form all around the SIA Guardians, except for Arun and Aswin. The Guardians try escaping out of the bubbles, but they are trapped inside. Niki moves her eyes over to Arun and Aswin. 

Niki 
Why isn’t it working on them?!?!

Aswin smiles. He cracks his knuckles towards his head, and cracks his neck towards his left.

Aswin points towards himself and makes a hand motion up and down. 

Aswin 
Chettiar Di!

Aswin slowly and weakly starts walking towards Niki. Niki repeatedly fires spells at Aswin, but none of them work. Aswin stumbles as he continues his walk towards Niki. Nidarshan lines up behind Niki. 

Niki 
Why aren’t any of them working!?!?!

Niki slightly moves her head, and tries to discreetly analyze the black cauldron full of liquid. 

Aswin 
Oh, so that cauldron is the source of all your power…

Niki 
If you touch that, you will die. Only those who are well trained and of the dark SAATH Magic can deal with it. Even if I touch a decent amount, I may be injured. But other people, like you, are guaranteed death. 

Aswin thinks about it. If the cauldron is destroyed, Niki loses her powers. The bombs are all connected to the potency of the cauldron. If the cauldron is destroyed, the bombs get destroyed. West Lafayette, the world, will all be saved. But is it worth sacrificing his life? 

Negha
Aswin, don’t do it!

Arun 
Aswin, don’t you dare!

Aswin starts backing away from the cauldron and turns around. 

Niki 
That’s what I thought!

Aswin quickly pivots and sprints to the cauldron. 

Negha 
ASWIN, NO!

Aswin grabs the cauldron with his hands with all his might. He is already so weak. The cauldron starts to burn his hands black. Aswin yells in pain. The pain is unbearable. His hands up to his forearms are completely charred black. 

Niki 
NOOO!

Aswin throws the cauldron at Niki, and the backsplash also hits Nidarshan. Niki and Nidarshan and sucked into the cauldron. Aswin falls to the ground due to the extremely painful recoil. The cauldron then vanishes into thin air.  Suddenly, the protective bubbles around the rest of the guardians disappear. A nearby display alerts that all bombs have been disarmed and neutralized. They fall to the ground and then rush to be by Aswin’s side. 

Their tears form a lake as they kneel beside Aswin’s lifeless body. The job is completed. The city is saved. All because of their leader’s, their hero’s, miraculous and brave sacrifice. 

The camera pans up around the scene and zooms out into plain darkness.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INT. TRIPLE XXX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The SIA Guardians are gathered around a large table in the bustling Triple XXX Restaurant. Arun, Priya, Sanjana, Negha, Sai Aiswarya, Hitha, Rishika, and Aadit are all revealed.
 Plates of food and drinks cover the table. The group is animated, laughing and joking around. 
MEDIUM SHOT: THE WHOLE GROUP
The camaraderie and warmth among them are palpable. 
 The camera slowly pans to the end of the table, revealing a pair of black scarred hands. The camera further moves up, revealing a smiling Aswin, who has a large scar across his face.
Negha 
So what do you guys think happened to Niki and Nidarshan? Where did the cauldron lead them to?


Arun 
Probably to grad school

The camera turns to Aswin. He is surrounded by all his friends. 
ASWIN 
“Friendship is everything. It’s the family we choose, the people who stand by us no matter what.”
Aswin winks at the camera
The screen begins to darken, with a circle closing in on Aswin's wink.
FADE TO BLACK.

THE END?
