Summer, 2024. 

Aswin Chidambaram Kumar hurriedly drags a large black bag through the tangled light green grass and yellow weeds of a remote field in Columbus, Indiana. The night is pitch black and silent, with the exception of crickets that hum to the melody of nature. Stars are scattered across the sky like drops of white paint flung upon a black canvas. Aswin reaches the center of the large field and puts down the bag. The bag is so large, it rivals Aswin’s own size. 

Aswin zips open the bag and steadily takes out the heavy instrument within the bag. A large box-like machine with wires connected all around flattens the grass beneath it. At the top of this machine lies a connected circular component that appears like a shining disk with a hollow inner circle. Suddenly Aswin’s phone rings. It’s his manager from Cummins. 

Josh 
Aswin, are you all set?

Aswin 
Yes, I’m all ready sir. Hope you're having a nice night. Let me connect to the network. 

Aswin retrieves his laptop from his bag and connects to his phone’s hotspot. He logs into the Cummins VPN and accesses the Cummins network. 

Aswin
I'm in, sir. 

Josh 
Excellent. Now Aswin, this is the last stage to the project you have been working on all these past months in your Co-op. This is the final test. All you have to do is shoot a random beam into the sky. Let’s see if it works. 

Aswin nods.

Aswin switches to a new screen on his laptop. In the center of the screen lies a button that reads ‘deploy.’ Aswin hesitantly clicks the button.

Aswin 
Ohm Namhashivaya

Suddenly, the machine starts making a whirring noise. The disk on the top of the machine turns light blue and slowly starts rotating.

Josh 
A good start…

The disk picks up speed and is now making hundreds of revolutions per second. The light blue is glowing even more fiercely. Aswin begins to back away. 

Suddenly, the machine shoots a silent white beam into the distant sky. Aswin’s fear morphs into a triumphant smile of joy and accomplishment.

Aswin jumps in the air in joy with his arms and legs spread out.

Aswin 
I did it!

Josh 
Excellent work Aswin. Please turn in the reactor to the plant office tomorrow. Safe to say, you can expect a job here for next summer. 

Aswin 
Thank you sir, have a very nice night.

The camera slowly zooms into Aswin’s brave and remarkably sharp eyes, and then fades into:

January, 2025. 

Cashews. Raisins. Jaggery. Rice. Ghee. Cardamom. Moong Dal. Sugar. 

Ingredient by ingredient, Negha masterfully crafts a sweet pongal that produces an ambrosial aroma that wafts through the entire bottom floor of the AAARCC. The guests of the event are captured by the smell and can not control their urges. The students leap off of their seats and are drawn to the kitchen, following the smell like a famished predator trailing its innocent prey. Negha turns around and is surprised by the crowds standing behind both entrances that lead into the kitchen. 

Negha
It’s not ready yet guys!
 
A group harmony of a sigh is heard as the students return back to the main room. Rishika has started the annual Pongal Jeopardy session, and the game races on. However, one girl does not join the game and remains back in the kitchen. 

Negha twirls around and comes face to face with the girl. 

“Sorry, I just love the smell of pongal.” 

Negha
No worries, what’s your name?

“My name is Arthi” 

Negha 
Nice to meet you. I’m Negha. Where are you from?

Arthi 
I’m from Singapore. 

Negha
No way, Aswin is from Singapore!

Suddenly, Sai Aiswarya, Arun, and Sanjana walk into the room. 

Sai Aiswarya
Where is Aswin? 

Negha
You don’t know? He’s coming back to campus late from home. Actually, he should be here by now!

Arun 
I miss Aswin. 

Arthi’s eye twitches. 

Arthi 
Who is this Aswin?

Negha Gasps. 

Negha
Sweet mother of boba!

Arun 
You don’t know Aswin? 

Sai Aiswarya
This is traumatizing 

Negha
Two years back, Aswin became the protector of this campus. He stunned people with his amazing strength, handsome smile, and beautiful heart. Aswin became the leader of the SIA Guardians.

Arthi
You said he’s from Singapore?

Sanjana
He’s not just from Singapore. The entire nation of Singapore is under his control!

Sai Aiswarya
Aswin is one who instills fear in fear itself…

Negha
Those piercing eyes!

Arun
That Same Smile!

Sanjana
That Same Walk!

Negha
Our vintage hero is back!

The door to the AAARCC flies open. The camera trails a muscular young man in slow motion, who stylishly removes his grey tommy hilfiger coat. The guests in the room all freeze in awe, as they can sense the aura of the man who has just entered the room. All the girls in the room turned in his direction and swooned at the sight of him. “He’s so handsome,” one girl squeals. The camera captures his hair waving in the air in slow motion, and then cuts to his sharp bold eyes, which could pop a balloon with just a brief glance. He smiles and displays his flashy white pearls, which could be mistaken for the bright flash of a camera. The man spins into the kitchen and leans against the counter. 

Aswin 
Hope you all are having a nice day
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pongal event is in full swing. Laughter fills the air as the elated students are having the time of their lives, feasting upon the scrumptious steaming pongal. Students crowd the dining room and at the table they begin to brush vibrant colors on to their own mini clay pots. 

Aswin and Arthi stand in the corner of the room, deep in conversation. 

Arthi 
What are some of the ways you’ve been involved on campus? 

Aswin 
I’ve built a rover to traverse through Mars and complete mission maintenance tasks with a robotic arm, a couple semesters back. 

Arthi 
Incredible… is this rover deployed on Mars? 

Aswin 
Yes it has been. It landed last summer at the NASA Space Station in Valles Marineris. You can even track the rover and there’s a live camera feed. 

Aswin pulls out his phone and switches to the NASA app. He clicks on the rover, named SIA-212. Aswin shows the screen to Arthi. 

On the screen: A dusty Martian terrain with wide canyons and rocky features. The rover slowly rolls across the radiant red rocks, its robotic arm repairing a solar panel of the space station as the camera pans left, revealing rocky cliffs in the distance. 

Arthi 
Aswin, you are a genius!

As Aswin smiles, he notices behind Arthi that a boy has dropped his mini pot and it is about to hit the floor. Arthi, with the reflexes of a quick sly leopard, pops to the ground and saves the pot from striking the hard wooden floor. The boy wholeheartedly thanks her. 

Aswin 
Amazing reflexes!

Arthi
Oh, I’m trained in Singaporean martial arts…

Aswin 
The SIA Guardians could use someone like you…

Arthi gives Aswin a subtle glance, the kind that implies ‘I’m in’ without a single word spoken.

Summer, 2024

In a galaxy far far away, on the shimmering planet of Negolodus, the triplet suns set behind the jagged skyline of a bustling, futuristic metropolis. The city glows with hues of teal and violet, contrasting from the dull grey terrain that covered the rest of the planet. Tall sleek silver buildings populate the city and are tightly packed, with only narrow crevices between buildings. Spacecrafts zip through the small crevices between the structures, leaving behind trails of blue smoke. 

At the heart of this futuristic city, in the center, lies the imperial building. The building twists like a helix towards the  sky and culminates in a circular meeting chamber at its peak, the royal meeting room. Above the roof lies the needle of space. This is the tallest point of the city. 

In the royal meeting room, the council of aliens surrounded a long oval table. The aliens are all leaf green in color, and have large dilated pupils. Their heads are smooth and disproportionately larger than the rest of their bodies. The aliens are all dressed in fancy royal blue suits. 

At the end of the table sat the queen, the ruler of the planet, guiding the meeting. She wore the grand purple gown of the leader. Her pupils are each glimmering dark violet. The queen’s presence was demanding and dominating, and even the other royal aliens feared her. 

Queen 
To the council I speak to, we will soon venture into the milky way galaxy, and Mars will be ours! Eventually, the entire universe will be in our control!

The other imperial aliens bang their green weapons, guns that shoot out lasers, on the table in excitement. 

Suddenly, a silent white beam strikes the needle of space above, causing the roof of the meeting room to come crumbling down. The aliens duck for cover under the royal desk. 

Queen 
Admira Ira, track the source of the beam, this could be an attack!

Admiral Ira, a dedicated assistant to the queen, rushes to his device. A holographic projection flickers to life above the oval table. The projection stabilizes and displays the planet Negolodus. The hologram begins to zoom out into the universe. First, it narrows to the Virgo Supercluster, then zooms closer to the local group of galaxies, before locking in on the milky way. Within the milky way, the projection narrows down to a solar system, and finally a large blue and green planet. The projection narrows even further and further and further…

Queen 
Where has the attack been administered from, Admiral?!

Admiral Ira
Columbus, Earth.
