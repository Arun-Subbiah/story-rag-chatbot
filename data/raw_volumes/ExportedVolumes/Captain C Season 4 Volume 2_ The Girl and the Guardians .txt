Captain C Season 4 Volume 2: The Girl and the Guardians

A copy of Thursday’s edition of the Exponent lies on the table in the Hawkins lobby. Two student workers, a girl and a boy, sit behind the desk, bored out of their minds. The camera focuses on the relaxed scene of the lobby, with people passing. Suddenly, the girl notices a shift in the air. 

Girl 
Hey, do you feel that?

Boy 
What? 

Girl 
I’m.. I’m getting goosebumps… 

Boy 
Wait, I’m feeling it too… there’s just this aura…

Heroic music begins to play. The camera focuses on the automatic sliding doors, which open in slow motion. Behind the doors stands a man in sunglasses. 

Aswin Chidambaram Kumar stylishly walks in and sits down in the chairs opposite to the front desk, where the students behind the counter watch him with saliva seeping from the corners of their mouths.

Girl 
He’s just so handsome! 

Aswin notices the girl staring at him. Aswin quickly turns his head and winks at the girl. The girl falls out of her chair. 

Aswin picks up a copy of the exponent and begins reading the top headline on the front page: Purdue’s SIA starts planning their big event, the Night Market. The event is scheduled for April 20th. Colleges across the nation are in awe of SIA’s success.

Aswin smiles. He flips to the second page. The headline reads: Purdue Theatre Director Reports UFO sighting. Aswin’s chettiar instinct begins to tingle. 

Aswin 
Thinks
Interesting….

Aswin continues to read. “Anne Marie Dammam, recently has reported a UFO sighting on her recent visit to Turkey Run State Park. Many have ridiculed her and doubt the validity to her claims. Many members of the cast of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, such as star actress Negha Sethuramalingam and costar Donovan Hibbeln have considered leaving the production in light of these claims.” 

Aswin 
Thinks
How peculiar….

Camera zooms into Aswin’s dark pupil, which fades into:

Sunday, 4pm. The SIA Board meeting is nearing its end. 

Sanjana
And we are planning our big event, the night bazaar, for April 20th!

The SIA Board Members burst into applause, their inner excitement and delight escaping from the sound of their hands coming together. 

Negha
Does anyone have any comments or suggestions for the event?

Ariman stands up. He shivers in excitement and does a short dance. 

Ariman 
I am just so excited for this event!

Ariman sits back down as the board enthusiastically cheers for his enthusiasm. 

Negha
Alright everyone, this is the end of the meeting. Have a very boba rest of your day.

The board members make their way out of the room, leaving just the core SIA Guardians at the long table. As Ajay leaves, an insect crawls up his pants. Once they are all gone, Aswin begins to speak. 


Aswin 
Everyone, I have a new announcement to make. I would like to introduce our newest SIA Guardian….

The SIA Guardians feet start to dance in anticipation. This news from their esteemed captain is very surprising. 

Aswin 
Arthi! 

Arthi climbs out from beneath the table and makes her way over to a chair. 

Aswin 
Hi there Arthi, hope you’re having a nice day.

The SIA Guardians clap their hands, which create a harmony of hope. 

Aswin 
To officially be inducted into the SIA Guardians, Arthi must take the oath of the Chettiar. This is a ritual that has been conducted for thousands of years within the Chettiar Community. 

Aswin retrieves his copy of the Chettiar Prophecy from his backpack and holds it up for Arthi. 

Aswin 
Put your hand on the prophecy 

Arthi puts her hand on the prophecy. She begins to recite the oath, loud and clear.

I take the oath of the Chettiar 
Under the training of Chettiar Captain Aswin 
Aswin, the leader of the Chettiars
Oh he is so mighty
I vow to protect my friends till the very end 

Suddenly, Arthi’s feet begin to lift off the ground. She hovers in the air and rises up all the way to the top of the room, just below the large circular chandelier. Rings of gold magic appear from mid-air and surround her, doing loops around her entranced body. The magic of the chettiar condenses and seeps within her, turning her eyes gold. Then, she slowly returns to the ground and shivers as she regains consciousness on top of the table. 



Aswin 
Welcome to the SIA Guardians! You now have extra protection through a layer of ancient Chettiar magic.

Compilation shots of Arthi bonding with her new team. The SIA are elated and impressed by Arthi’s attitude. 

The camera pans over to Rishika, who suddenly gets a call.

Rishika
Detective Rishika, from Rishika Detective Agency 

Rishika nods a couple of times and writes down some notes in her small flip book. Her dedication is astounding. 

Aswin 
Rishika, what’s the matter

Rishika
I’ve got a complaint from Dakshin. Apparently, bags of rice are mysteriously being found torn apart and empty

Aswin 
Dakshin and missing rice you say? This sounds very similar to our situation there last year, around this time. Rishika, I want you to get on top of this investigation 

Rishika looks at the camera

Rishika
The investigation. Starts. Now! 

Rishika does a salute to the camera and makes her way out of the room, on her new mission.

Summer 2024

In the now damaged imperial building in the capital city of the planet Negolodus, the Alien Queen meets with her council to discuss the source of the attack. 

Queen
Earth has fired upon us, yet we thought they were weak. They have declared war.

Admiral Ira 
Your highness, a special source of energy has been detected in the city of Columbus and in West Lafayette a few months prior. Analyzing the energy source and readings, I have detected a powerful Chettiar presence in the area

The Queen is utterly shocked.

Queen 
Chettiars?!?!? 

Admiral Ira
Should we attack Earth before Mars? 

Queen 
No, young admiral. Earth seems to be strong, especially with a Chettiar presence. First we will prepare for the invasion of Mars in January. We will force the Mars Martians to join our army for the invasion on Earth. And soon, we will colonize planet by planet, and the entire universe will be ours!

The other imperial aliens bang their green weapons on the table in excitement. 

Queen 
I have a task for you Admiral. You must become a spy on Earth, taking on the homosapien form. 

Admiral Ira
Yes your majesty. 

Queen 
Take this drug our R&D division has developed. 

Admiral Ira takes the drug, and slowly turns into a human. However, his face is not revealed. 

Queen 
You must join this Purdue university. You will locate the Chettiar presence on the campus and neutralize any potential powerful sources of resistance that could oppose our colonization efforts. And here, take this. This will be critical for your mission. 

The Queen hands Admiral Ira a mysterious silver box that is enclosed on all sides. 

To be Continued.
