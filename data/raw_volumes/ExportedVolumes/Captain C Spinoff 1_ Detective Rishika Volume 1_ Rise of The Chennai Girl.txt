Everything is red. A red that is rich and unforgiving, like the lava that boils at the depths of a volcano. The red pulses slightly, like a heartbeat. It glistens and radiates power, representing both the energy of creation and the fury of destruction. 

The camera slowly zooms out. The red forms a perfect circle- a pottu, resting confidently in the center of her forehead. The camera moves even further back, revealing her sharp eyes. Her eyes shift from left to right like a pendulum. 

Rishika is sitting at her desk, typing up a report in google docs. Suddenly, her phone rings. Rishika looks at her phone, and smiles. She picks up the phone.

Rishika 
Hey, how are you? 

Friend
Pretty good! Are you in Chennai?

Rishika
Unfortunately not. I’m staying back for winter break.

Friend
Oh no! Why is that?

Rishika
Captain C is on leave. He’s gone on a trip to Singapore. I have to stay back and cover for him.

Friend
Oh… There’s a movie re-releasing and I was thinking we could watch it together

Rishika 
Too bad so Sad

Rishika hangs up and gets back to work. She then turns around and makes eye contact with the camera.

Rishika 
I’ve been on duty in West Lafayette for about a week. It started with a missing handbag case. And then a chain snatching case. And then a burglary. 

Rishika sharpens her eyebrows

Rishika 
I solved all of these cases in record time. I no longer have the monicker of ‘The Chennai Girl.’ 

Rishika adjusts her pottu

Rishika
I am now Detective Rishika.

Rishika is getting ready to go to bed. She looks at the clock. It is New Year’s Eve, 11:20pm. Suddenly, a phone rings next to her personal phone. 

Rishika
The Rishika detective agency hotline…

Rishika picks up the phone

Rishika 
This is Rishika Detective Agency, what can I do for you 

Stranger
My wife! She’s missing and I can’t find her! Oh no Oh no what do I do?

Rishika 
Sir, calm down! Tell me, when did you see her last?

Stranger 
It was just about an hour ago. She went to take out the trash. From inside, I heard a loud thud, a scream, and then silence. I raced out to see what was happening, and she was just gone!

Rishika 
I’ll be right over, I need to investigate the scene of the crime. What is your address?

——————————————————————————————————————————

Rishika rides a veo past Windsor, through the woods of Celery Bog, by Walmart, and through the apartments of Lark. She checks the correct apartment number on her phone and parks the veo. Rishika checks the time. 11:40pm She knocks on a door on the ground floor. 

Knock, Knock

Rishika
Rishika, college Detective 

The door frantically swings open. A man of age 40 opens the door. His expression is aghast and his hair is all shaken up. He is dressed in a nice red sweater. His eyes are sunken, as if he has been crying for hours. 

Stranger
Rishika! I’m John. John Schmidt. 

Rishika
Mr. Schmidt. Take me to where you heard the commotion! 

John 
It was just out here. She was taking trash to the dumpster near the bus stop, but something happened midway. See, the trash bag is on the floor on the lawn. 

Rishika and John run out to the lawn in front of the apartment building. A bag of trash is leaking its contents across the grass. 

Rishika
Inspecting the scene carefully
Did you hear anything? Screams? Footsteps?

John
Nothing clear, just a muffled shout, and then… silence. I ran out here, and she was gone.
Rishika crouches down, her sharp eyes scanning the lawn. Among the spilled trash, her gaze locks onto a single blue pen lying on the grass.
Rishika
Picking up the pen
Could this be your wife’s?

John inspects the pen carefully. Blue.

John 
It can’t be. We only use red and green pens!

Rishika puts the pen in a ziploc bag, for evidence. 

Rishika
Ok, I’m going to have to look through the house now

John takes Rishika back to the apartment, while Rishika asks John a few questions.


Rishika
So tell me sir, what do you do 

John 
I'm a professor of Computer Science. 

Rishika
And your wife?

John 
Mary? She works as a professor in the Psychology department 

Rishika and John walk through the front door.

Rishika 
And what were you doing before this happened?

John 
We had just finished dinner and I was washing dishes while she went out to throw the trash out. And then I heard the commotion outside.

Rishika
Do you suspect anyone?

John 
There was one student giving her problems.. Following her around, asking for grade boosts. It became pretty severe, we had to get the police to talk to him. But that was over a month ago! 

Rishika 
Interesting

Rishika walks around the house, closely examining each square inch of the abode. She moves methodically from room to room, her eyes scanning every detail. The living room is perfectly arranged, not a cushion out of place. The kitchen counters gleam, free of even a speck of dust, and the trash can is free of a trash bag. In the bedroom, the bed is made with crisp, precise folds. Every corner of the house is eerily immaculate, leaving no hint of a struggle or anything amiss.

Rishika 
Neat house you got there

John chuckles slightly 
Rishika’s eyes narrow as she inspects the dining table, its surface sparkling clean. She runs a hand over the surface of the table. Something feels off. She crouches down, her heart pounding, and peers beneath. In the shadow, near the far leg of the table, she spots it—a small box. She pulls it out, her hands trembling.
 Inside are 12 glistening green grapes.
