Priya McNamara stands on the edge of a cliff, cornered by three dragon masked foes. One missed step, and Priya will fall a fall of more than three hundred feet.

The dragon faced enemies point their swords right at the edge of Priya’s neck. Priya takes a step back, but the rock ledge begins to crumble. If the ledge breaks off, a stumble to the bottom is inevitable.

The camera cuts to Priya’s sharp, intense eyes. 

Priya
Thinking 
How did I even get to this point? 

The camera moves up from the tense standoff up to the vast dark sky above and the clouds that fill it up.

“Priya, it’s up to you to protect the dragon skull” 

These were the words that put me in this situation.

The words that put me on the edge.

——————————————————————————————————————————

Priya pants as she walks up the final steps of the temple, looking up. She stretches her neck, trying to scale the temple block by block, but the temple is just too tall. 

Exactly 3,475 steps to the top of the mountain, where the temple lies. 

Priya makes another step.


Priya
Heavily Breathing 
Step 3,475

Priya turns around and is met with a breathtaking view of the mountainous region of Japan. 

She now stands in front of the grand entrance to the temple. The 15 feet door is made out of wood, with sharp steel designes glistening across it. Lamps are lit with fire on both sides of the doors. Priya is in awe of the grandness of the building. 

Just as Priya is about to knock on the door, the door slowly opens inwards. Priya takes a step back in surprise.

Inside the doorframe, and elderly man fraily stands, balancing himself on a wooden stick. He wears the straw hat and white outfit of an advanced sensei. 

The man scans Priya for a moment, and then nods. 

“Welcome young grasshopper”

Priya 
Sensei Yu 

Sensei Yu 
Yes, Yu is me. My brother, Sensei Me in Purdue university speaks very highly of you 

Priya bows

Sensei Yu 
No time to waste. Your training starts now. 

Priya  spends the day mastering precise strikes and defensive stances under Sensei Yu’s instruction. As the sun begins to set, she practices balancing on narrow wooden beams, her movements growing steadier with each attempt. By dusk, she’s sparring with Sensei Yu himself, their black silhouettes framed by the pink color of the sky. As night falls, Priya collapses to her knees, panting. 

Sensei Yu looks down to the ground at Priya.

Sensei Yu 
Tired already? The reason you are here, the mission you are on, only starts from here. The Night. 

——————————————————————————————————————————

Priya walks up the stairs to the upper floor of the corec and walks in. A group of 10 in black karate outfits are there. The sensei is at the front of the room. 

Priya walks to the front of the room and bows. 

Sensei Me 
Welcome Priya. Please stay after class today, I have to speak with you.

Priya bows and joins the rest of the students.

Sensei Me
Please pair up with your dueling partners

Priya turns around and comes face to face with an old friend. 

Priya 
Kenji!

Kenji bows in respect 

Kenji
(smiling)
I won’t go easy on you 

Priya
(Smiling back)
And I wouldn’t want you to.

Priya and Kenji duel for the next hour of practice, growing their skills and experience in the process. At the end of the class, Priya shakes Kenji’s hand before walking up to Sensei Me’s office.


Priya
Sensei…

Sensei Me 
Welcome Priya. How do you feel about studying abroad? This summer?

Priya
Study abroad? I would love to!

Sensei Me
Good. However, this is no ordinary foreign exchange class. Only on University records is this a 3 credit course…

Priya 
Then what is it?

Sensei Me
My older brother, Sensei Yu lives atop Mount Paoji, in Japan. He has asked me to send my most skilled Ninja to Japan for a mission. 

Priya 
A mission?

Sensei Me
Atop Mount Paoji lies the ancient temple of TuKud. Inside the temple lies a chamber room protecting an ancient artificact that is important to the lives of all of our sect of Ninjas

Priya, it’s up to you to protect the dragon skull.

——————————————————————————————————————————

Priya and Sensei Yu stand in front of the temple gate entrance. Night has fallen. The area is now completely dark, only enlightened by the oil lamps that light up soft, red flames that surround the temple. 

Sensei Yu
Priya, this group of thieves are trying to breach temple premises multiple times a week. I couldn’t fight them all on my own, so I asked my brother to send help. This is an extremely important mission. You must spend the night guarding the temple, protecting the dragon skull. 

Priya nods. A crane flies down from the roof above the first layer of the temple, and perches itself on the shoulder of Sensei Yu.


Sensei Yu 
I’m sure Me has told you about the legend of the Dragon?

Priya nods once again. What a story that was.

——————————————————————————————————————————

Sensei Me
Long ago in Japan, a dragon served as the protector of the region, alongside the ninjas. The dragon was called the three horned guardian, or the guardian for short. The dragon accompanied the ninjas in battle across the land. 

However, a group of misfit ninjas diverged from the original group, and created a separate sect: the rebels. Their goal was to ruin the peace and democracy maintained by the ninjas, and rule the entirety of Japan by themselves.

The rebels and ninjas fought countless wars over control for Japan. In the final war, also known as the Great War, the dragon delivered the final blow on the rebels, using all its strength and might. The rebels were eliminated. 

However, with this last effort, the dragon was reduced to ashes, leaving behind just one part:

The Dragon Skull.

The ninjas believe the soul of the Dragon still remains within the skull, and the Guardian can return anytime in which the ninjas need its help.

Some believe we haven’t seen the last of the rebels, and their descendants may still be plotting the fall of the Japanese region and the ninja empire.

Recently, groups of thieves have been attacking the temple. But their motives are unknown. Are they just after jewels and treasure? 

Or are they after the skull?

——————————————————————————————————————————

Sense Yu
I believe they are after the skull. The style of attack, the swiftness in their movement; it resembles that of the rebels just so well. 

It is of utmost importance that we protect the skull and protect it from getting in their hands.

The skull is the very heart of the ninja. It’s what unites us all and gives us power. 

Priya
Sensei Yu, I will protect this temple with all my strength and energy 

Sense Yu
Very well. On you go with this mission.

——————————————————————————————————————————

Sense Me
Very well. On you go with this mission. And don’t forget, remember the guardian. 

Priya bows and heads out the room, leaving the Corec with a new found sense of determination and will. 

——————————————————————————————————————————

Sensei Yu 
I will protect this North Gate of the temple. You will protect the South Gate. 

Priya 
Sensei, I’m a bit scared. This is a completely new situation for me. Do I have what it takes to finish the job?

Sensei Yu
Fear sharpens the mind; courage moves the body. You have what it takes. It is your fear that holds you back. Act with courage. 

Priya 
Yes sensei 

Sensei Yu
And don’t forget, remember the guardian. 

Priya bows and starts to head through the temple on the way to the South Gate, leaving the entrance with determination and will. 

——————————————————————————————————————————

Priya reaches the South Gate door. She opens the door and is met with a frightening surprise. Beyond the gate leads to a narrow ledge. Below the ledge is a drop off of over three hundred feet. 

Priya gasps. She is literally on the edge of a cliff- a cliff hanger! 

Priya stumbles back to the door and pulls out her sword, readying it in a fighting stance. 

Priya 
Thinking 
And now we wait.

And wait is what Priya did. Hours and hours passed, but only the blank dark biting silence remained constant. Priya thought, where are the thieves?

As sleep began to tackle her eyes, a quick rustle was heard from above. Priya’s consciousness was quickly alerted. Priya resumes her fighting stance.

Priya 
Who’s there!?!

Suddenly, off the roof, a group of three thieves jump below. They all point their swords at Priya, daring her to step forward into a duel.

Priya stands before the gate in fright. Her own words echoed through her ears. 

Sensei Yu, I will protect this temple with all my strength and energy 

Priya points her sword right back at the thieves, accepting their challenge. 
The thieves charge at Priya, their strikes quick and merciless. She defends fearfully, her movements faltering as they push her back from the gate toward the cliff’s edge.
Priya McNamara stands on the edge of a cliff, cornered by three dragon masked foes. One missed step, and Priya will fall a fall of more than three hundred feet.

The dragon faced enemies point their swords right at the edge of Priya’s neck. Priya takes a step back, but the rock ledge begins to crumble. If the ledge breaks off, a stumble to the bottom is inevitable.

The camera cuts to Priya’s sharp, intense eyes. 
Her breath quickens as her heels falter over the crumbling ledge. Pinned with nowhere to go, she remembers Sensei Yu’s words: Fear sharpens the mind; courage moves the body. 
“Remember the guardian“
As the thieves close in, Priya springs into the air, flipping over their heads. As she is in the air, the thieves simultaneously move forward to strike. 
The ground beneath the thieves crumbles. They slip, their screams echoing as they disappear into the abyss.
Priya stands by the gate, confidently gripping her sword tightly as the night swallows the silence, waiting for more enemies to come. 
Priya looks forward into the midnight sky blanketing the mountains in darkness. 
“Remember the guardian“
Cut to end credits.
